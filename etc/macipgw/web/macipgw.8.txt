NAME
       macipgw - MacIP Gateway Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       macipgw  [ -d debugclass ]  [ -n nameserver ]  [ -z zone ]
       [ -V ] network netmask

DESCRIPTION
       macipgw provides IP  connectivity  for  devices  connected
       through  an  AppleTalk-only  network,  i. e.  LocalTalk or
       Apple Remote Access (ARA). macipgw is normally started out
       of /etc/rc.

       MacIP  (formerly  known  as KIP) is a protocol that allows
       the encapsulation of  IP  packets  in  AppleTalk  packets.
       macipgw  registers  itself  as  a  MacIP  gateway  on  the
       AppleTalk network and configures and brings  up  a  tunnel
       interface  (see  tun(4)).  It  then  forwards  IP  packets
       received from the AppleTalk network to the kernel  through
       the   tunnel  interface.  Likewise,  IP  packets  received
       through the tunnel are forwarded to the  AppleTalk  device
       registered for the destination IP address.

       Unlike  other  MacIP  gateways,  macipgw  needs its own IP
       (sub-)net to operate, and does not use proxy-ARP  for  the
       addresses  registered.  The  gateway  will  always use the
       first address in the network for the local address,  i. e.
       192.168.1.1 for the network 192.168.1.0/24.

       macipgw  will  log  operational messages through syslog(3)
       under the facility LOG_DAEMON.

OPTIONS
       -d debugclass
              Specifies that the daemon should not fork, and that
              a  trace  of  all actions be written to stdout. See
              the source code for useful values of debugclass.

       -n nameserver
              Specifies the IP address of a DNS name  server  the
              AppleTalk  devices  connected  through  the gateway
              should use.

       -z zone
              Specifies that  macipgw  should  register  in  zone
              instead of the default zone.

       -V     Show version information and exit.

       network
              Specifies   the  network  number  to  use  for  the
              clients.

       netmask
              Specifies the netmask for the network.

EXAMPLE
       /usr/local/libexec/macipgw  -n  192.168.1.1   -z   "Remote
       Users" 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

       Starts  macipgw, assigning the Class C network 192.168.1.0
       for devices connected through the gateway, specifying that
       the  system  macipgw  is  running on can be used as a name
       server, and that it should register  in  the  zone  Remote
       Users.

FILES
       /usr/local/libexec/macipgw

BUGS
       No  information  besides  the log messages is available on
       which AppleTalk devices are using the gateway.
