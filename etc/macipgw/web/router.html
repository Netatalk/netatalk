<H1>Configuring atalkd(8) as an AppleTalk router</H1>

<P>If you plan to use netatalk with only one interface, simply enter the interface's name into <TT>etc/atalkd.conf</TT>, i. e.:</P>
<DL>
<DD><TT>ed0</TT></DD>
</DL>

<P>If you plan to use netatalk with more than one interface, you'll need to configure <B>atalkd(8)</B> as a router.</P>

<P>For the following instructions, we assume you are familiar with the basic operation of your system. Also, you should be logged in as 'root'.</P>


<A name="sec1"><H2>1. Preparing to configure atalkd(8) as a router</H2></A>

<P>Before you can start configuring <B>atalkd(8)</B> as an AppleTalk router, you'll need to find out the network configuration of the networks the system will be connected to. Specifically, you'll need to know whether another AppleTalk router is connected to one or more of the networks, and how the router is configured. AppleTalk requires that all routers connected to the same network are configured identically for that network.</P>

<P>It might be a good idea to ask you network or system adminstrator about AppleTalk routers installed on you network and their configuration.</P>

<P>You'll then need to make a plan of all networks your router is connected to, and the configuration for each of them.</P>

<P>Finally, you can configure <B>atalkd(8)</B> by making appropiate entries in it's configuration file, <TT>atalkd.conf</TT>.</P>


<H3>Do this to determine the network configuration:</H3>

<OL>
<LI><P>Make a table with the four columns Interface, Seed, Netrange,
    and Zones.</P></DT>

<LI><P>In the first column Interface, write down each of the interface names
    for the networks you plan to use, i. e.:</P>
<P><TABLE border=1>
<TR><TH>Interface</TH><TH>Seed</TH><TH>Netrange</TH><TH>Zones</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>ed0</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ed1</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<LI><P>Configure <B>atalkd(8)</B> to use only the first interface you plan to use.</P>
<P>Simply enter the interface's name into <TT>atalkd.conf</TT>, i. e.
<DL>
<DD><TT>ed0</TT></DD>
</DL></P>

<LI><P>Start <B>atalkd(8)</B>.</P>

<P><B>atalkd(8)</B> will need some 30 seconds to start up.</P>

<LI><P>Look in <TT>atalkd.conf</TT> to determine the network number range. If the line for
    the interface looks like
<DL>
<DD><TT>ed0 -phase 2 -net 1-1 -addr 1.35</TT></DD>
</DL>
    enter the two numbers following <TT>-net</TT> into the third column, Netrange. I. e.:</P>

<P><TABLE border=1>
<TR><TH>Interface</TH><TH>Seed</TH><TH>Netrange</TH><TH>Zones</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>ed0</TD><TD></TD><TD>1-1</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ed1</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>If the line reads
<DL>
<DD><TT>ed0 -phase 2 -net 65280-65534 -addr 65280.35</TT>
</DL>
    there is no router on this network, so you don't need any information and you can proceed with step 7.</P>

<LI><P>Use the command <TT>getzones -l</TT> to find out the list of zone names available
    on this network, i. e.:

<DL><DD><TT>$ getzones -l<BR>
	Accounting<BR>
	Engineering</TT></DD>
</DL></P>

<P>Enter the zone list for this interface into the fourth column, Zones. I. e.:</P>

<P><TABLE border=1>
<TR><TH>Interface</TH><TH>Seed</TH><TH>Netrange</TH><TH>Zones</TH></TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed0</TD>
  <TD></TD>
  <TD>1-1</TD>
  <TD>"Accounting", "Engineering"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed1</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></P>

<LI><P>Stop <B>atalkd(8)</B> and remove the interface line from <TT>atalkd.conf</TT> you entered in step 2.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> On some systems, a reboot is necessary before you can start <B>atalkd(8)</B> again.</P>

<LI><P>Repeat steps 2 to 7 for each of the other interfaces you plan to use.</P><DT>
</OL>

<A name="sec2"><H2>2. Planning the network configuration</H2></A>

<P>Now you'll need to complete the table. If you already have filled in each line of the table with a network number range (column Netrange) and a zone list (Zones) in <A href="#sec1">Section 1</A>, your network configuration is complete and you can proceed with <A href="#sec3">Section 3</A>.</P>

<P>For each row without a Netrange or Zone, you'll need to assign that information to the network.</P> 

<H3>Do this to assign network number ranges and zones:</H3>

<OL ><LI><P>In the second column Seed, make a check mark for each interface that
    doesn't have a network number range, i. e.:</P>

<P><TABLE border=1>
<TR><TH>Interface</TH><TH>Seed</TH><TH>Netrange</TH><TH>Zones</TH></TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed0</TD>
  <TD></TD>
  <TD>1-1</TD>
  <TD>"Accounting", "Engineering"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed1</TD>
  <TD>X</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></P>

<LI><P>Assign a network number range to each interface that does not have one yet. Use
    the following rules to assign a network number range:</P>

<OL start=a type=a>
<LI><P>Determine how many AppleTalk devices will be connected to that
	    network. A gross estimate should suffice. For each 253 devices
	    you'll need one network number. Leave some room for growth. Make a
	    note of how many network numbers you'll need.</P>

<LI><P>Choose an arbitrary number between 1 and 65279. This will be the
	    start of your network number range.</P>
<LI><P>Add the count of network numbers you need, minus one, to the start
	    of the range. This will be the end of the range. Make sure this
	    number is at most 65279.</P>
<LI><P>Look at your table to make sure that none of the network numbers in
	    the network number range you have choosen is assigned to any other
	    network.</P>
<LI><P><B>Important:</B> Make sure your network number range isn't used on any
	    other network you'll might be connected to through another router.
	    To find out which other network numbers are in use, you'll need
	    to ask you network or system administrator. Alternatively, you can
	    check the configuration of every AppleTalk router on your network,
	    although this can be quite tedious.</P>

	    <P>If you fail to assure this, you're <B>complete</B> AppleTalk network
	    might break down!</P>

</OL>
<P><DL>
<DT>Example:</DT>
<DD>You are configuring a router for a network that has approximatly
	    100 devices. You estimate that this number will grow only moderately
	    in the future, so you'll need a single network number only.
	    Because interface <TT>ed0</TT> has the network number range <TT>1-1</TT>, you choose
	    the number 2, and enter <TT>2-2</TT> into the field for interface <TT>ed1</TT>.
</DL></P>

<LI><P>Assign one or more zone names to each interface <B>that do not already have
    one</B>. You can choose the zone name arbitrarily. You can choose the same zone
    name as on another interface. You can even give all interfaces the same zone
    name.</P> 

<P><B>Important:</B> Don't add zone names to the interfaces that you already obtained
    a zone list for in <A href="#sec2">section 1</A>. If you do, your network won't work reliably.</P>
</OL>

<P>Your table should now look like this:</P>

<P><TABLE border=1>
<TR><TH>Interface</TH><TH>Seed</TH><TH>Netrange</TH><TH>Zones</TH></TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed0</TD>
  <TD></TD>
  <TD>1-1</TD>
  <TD>"Accounting", "Engineering"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
  <TD>ed1</TD>
  <TD>X</TD>
  <TD>2-2</TD>
  <TD>"Engineering"</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>You now have all the necessary information to configure <B>atalkd(8)</B>.</P>


<A name="sec3"><H2>3. Configuring atalkd(8)</H2></A>

<H3>Do this to configure atalkd(8):</H3>

<OL>
<LI><P>Open <TT>atalkd.conf</TT> in your favorite text editor.</P>

<LI><P>For each line in your table, enter one line into the editor. If the Seed
    field for an interface isn't checked, just enter the interface name, i. e.:</P>

<P><DL>
<DD><TT>ed0</TT></DD>
</DL></P>

<P>If you have checked the Seed field, enter the interface name, the <TT>-seed</TT>
    paramter, the network number range, and the zone list, i. e.:</P>

<P><DL>
<DD><TT>ed1 -seed -net 2-2 -zone "Engineering"</TT>
</DL></P>

    <P><B>Important:</B> Make sure to enter all paramters for an interface on a single
    line, or <B>atalkd(8)</B> won't be able to read the configuration file.</P>

<P>Your <TT>atalkd.conf</TT> should now look like this:</P>

<P><DL>
<DD><TT>ed0<BR>
ed1 -seed -net 2-2 -zone "Engineering"</TT>
</DL></P>

<LI><P>Save the file and start <B>atalkd(8)</B>.</P>
</OL>

<P>After some time, <B>atalkd(8)</B> should be running. You can now use <B>nbplkup(1)</B> and <B>getzones(1)</B> to check that all networks are availible.</P>
