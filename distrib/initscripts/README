Running Netatalk daemons through systemd is an alternative to the legacy
sysv scripts. By configuring Netatalk with the "--enable-systemd" flag
make will install systemd unit configurations and enable them for daemons
that were enabled.

After installation, you may start the services as per the below. They will
also be started automatically on the next system boot.

The following systemd unit configurations are mandatory and enable AFP over TCP.

    netatalk.service
    netatalk-cnid.service

Optional systemd unit configurations for legacy services.

    netatalk-atalkd.service
    netatalk-papd.service
    netatalk-a2boot.service
    netatalk-timelord.service

You must control the Netatalk service by starting/stopping netatalk.service only,
because netatalk-cnid.service is controlled automatically.

    # systemctl start|stop|restart netatalk.service

The netatalk-atalkd.service unit is requried for the remaining three,
however those three are independent from each other.

These unit configurations start daemons directly and do not read "netatalk.conf".
Therefore, you need to edit files for setting certain options.

    ATALK_NAME:         set in afpd.conf instead
    AFPD_MAX_CLIENTS:   set in netatalk.service by using -c
    AFPD_UAMLIST:       set in afpd.conf instead with -uamlist
    AFPD_GUEST:         set in afpd.conf instead with -guestname
    ATALK_MAC_CHARSET:  set in afpd.conf instead with -maccodepage
    ATALK_UNIX_CHARSET: set in afpd.conf instead with -unixcodepage
    CNID_CONFIG:        set in netatalk-cnid.service by using -l and -f options
