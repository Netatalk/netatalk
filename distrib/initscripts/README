Running Netatalk daemons through systemd is an alternative to the legacy
sysv scripts. By configuring Netatalk with the "--enable-systemd" flag
make will install systemd unit configurations and enable them for daemons
that were enabled.

After installation, you may start the services as per the below. They will
also be started automatically on the next system boot.

The following services are mandatory and enable AFP over TCP.

    afpd.service
    cnid.service

Optional services for legacy AppleTalk daemons.

    atalkd.service
    papd.service
    a2boot.service
    timelord.service

You must control the Netatalk service by starting/stopping afpd.service.
The cnid.service is controlled automatically.

    # systemctl start|stop|restart afpd.service

The atalkd.service unit is requried for the remaining three,
however those three are independent from each other.

These unit configurations start daemons directly and do not read "netatalk.conf".
Therefore, you need to edit files for setting certain options.

    ATALK_NAME:         set in afpd.conf
    ATALK_ZONE:         set in atalkd.conf with -zone
    AFPD_MAX_CLIENTS:   set in afpd.service by starting the daemon with -c
    AFPD_UAMLIST:       set in afpd.conf with -uamlist
    AFPD_GUEST:         set in afpd.conf with -guestname
    ATALK_MAC_CHARSET:  set in afpd.conf with -maccodepage
    ATALK_UNIX_CHARSET: set in afpd.conf with -unixcodepage
    CNID_CONFIG:        set in cnid.service by starting the daemon with -l and -f
