netatalk (1.4b2+asun2.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libatalk1 and libatalk1-dev (I think it is a mistake to "fork" a
    shared version of a library in Debian, if the library is static upstream
    then upstream isn't gonna be careful with the ABI).

  * Correct paths in psf.8 (closes:Bug#30839).
  * There is now a different way to control CRLF translation on a
    per-volume basis upstream so I have removed the patch that
    provides the -e option to afpd.
  * (netatalk): Depend on libpam-modules.
  * Put man pages in /usr/share/man.

netatalk (1.4b2+asun2.0a18.2-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New "upstream" release.
  * This does add new features, however, it also fixes at
    least one nasty bug (Bug#13973).
  * Applied patch which adds a command-line option to disable
    CR/LF translation (thanks to Davide Welton and Jon Nelson).
    (Note to release manager: this patch is applied so this
     package has the exact functionality of netatalk-asun)
  * Renamed libatalk-dev to libatalk1-dev.
  * Symlinked /usr/man/man1/nbpunrgstr.1.gz to /usr/man/man1/nbprgstr.1.gz
    to keep lintian happy.
  * Changed the "lock directory" to /var/run and the names of the "lock files" to <foo>.pid,
    since what the source calls locks are really the same as the .pid files other daemons
    put in /var/run.
  * This package provides all the functionality of netatalk-asun, and
    it will replace netatalk-asun in the distribution.

 -- Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org>  Tue, 12 May 1998 19:31:54 -0700

netatalk (1.4b2-4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yet Another non-maintainer release.
  * Added patch to fix "dancing icon" problems with Macs running Mac OS 8.
  * Changed comment in /etc/AppleVolumes.default (Bug:#15279)
  * Implemented variable for "server name" in init script
    (as suggested in Bug:#12024)
  * Added a kluge to /etc/init.d/netatalk to remove kernel appletalk
    module (if there is one) at stop and reinsert it at start, this
    is needed or else netatalk will not start once stopped (Bug:#12142,11349)

 -- Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org>  Fri, 30 Jan 1998 07:50:00 -0800

netatalk (1.4b2-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer libc6 compile.

 -- Joel Klecker <jk@espy.org>  Tue, 6 Jan 1998 00:00:00 -0800

netatalk (1.4b2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled against newer PAM libraries.
  * Added /etc/pam.d/samba.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Sat, 8 Mar 1997 01:17:09 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added PAM support.
  * Split into libatalk, libatalk-dev, and netatalk.
  * Added patch from Randy Gobbel <gobbel@cogsci.ucsd.edu> to allow case
    translation to be specified at config-time rather than compile time.
    Note that configuration files that make use of this feature may not
    work with other releases of netatalk, and that this feature may be
    removed in the future if UMich rejects the patch or implements it
    differently.
  * Startup messages now conform to 'Standard for Console Messages' (fixes
    #5399).
  * No longer creates new subdirectories (to appease dpkg-buildpackage).

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Feb 1997 21:02:02 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Resend_request made external for libnatali.
  * Added shared libraries.
  * Next revision will split into libatalk, libatalk-dev, and netatalk.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jan 1997 22:37:22 -0500

netatalk (1.4b2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to upstream version 1.4b2.
  * Added preliminary PAM support (currently disabled).
  * Made /etc/init.d/netatalk a conffile.
  * Changed /etc/init.d/netatalk to complete only once appletalk services
    are running.  Configurating an Appletalk interface can take many (> 15)
    seconds, so the previous version would fork a process to configure the
    interface and then start up the other Appletalk services.  Although
    possibly controversial, this change is necessary so that packages like
    ppr can be ensured that netatalk will be started before they run
    without undue complication.

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Sat, 2 Nov 1996 19:42:04 -0700
