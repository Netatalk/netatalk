       Fixes bug #505.
* UPD: Use FreeBSD sendfile() capability to send protocol header.
       From FR #75.
* UPD: Increase IO size when sendfile() is not used.
       From FR #76.

       Fixes bug #508.
* FIX: Setting POSIX ACLs on Linux
       Fixes bug #506.
* FIX: "ad ls" segfault if requested object is not in an AFP volume.
       Fixes bug #496.

Changes in 3.0.2
================
* NEW: afpd: Put file extension type/creator mapping back in which had
       been removed in 3.0.
* NEW: afpd: new option 'ad domain'. From FR #66.
* FIX: volumes and home share with symlinks in the path

       Fixes bug #473.
* FIX: Dont copy our metadata EA in copyfile(). Fixes bug #452.
* FIX: Fix an error where catalog search gave incomplete results.
       Fixes bug #479.
* REM: Remove TimeMachine volume used size FCE event.
* UPD: Add quoting support to '[in]valid users' option. Fixes bug #472.
* FIX: Install working PAM config on Solaris 11. Fixes bug #481.
* FIX: Fix a race condition between dbd and the cnid_dbd daemon
       which could result in users being disconnected from volumes
       when dbd was scanning their volumes. Fixes bug #477.
* FIX: Netatalk didn't start when the last line of the config file
       afp.conf wasn't terminated by a newline. Fixes bug #476.
* NEW: Add a new volumes option 'follow symlinks'. The default setting is
       false, symlinks are not followed on the server. This is the same
       behaviour as OS X's AFP server.
       Setting the option to true causes afpd to follow symlinks on the
       server. symlinks may point outside of the AFP volume, currently
       afpd doesn't do any checks for "wide symlinks".
* FIX: Automatic AppleDouble conversion to EAs failing for directories.
       Fixes bug #486.
* FIX: dbd failed to convert appledouble files of symlinks.
       Fixes bug #490.

Changes in 3.0.1

Changes in 3.0 beta1
====================

* UPD: afpd: Performance tuning of read/write AFP operations. New option
       "afp read locks" (default: no) which disables that the server
       applies UNIX byte range locks to regions of files in AFP read and
       write calls.
* UPD: apple_dump: Extended Attributes AppleDouble support.
       (*BSD is not supported yet)

Changes in 3.0 alpha3
=====================

* NEW: afpd: Per volume "login message", NetAFP bug ID #18

       with Solaris CIFS/SMB server. Uses new Solaris fcntl F_SHARE share
       reservation locking primitives. Enabled by default, set global
       "solaris share reservations" option to false to disable it.
* NEW: ad: ad set subcommand for changing Mac metadata on the server
* UPD: unix charset is UTF8 by default.
       vol charset is same value as unix charset by default.
* UPD: .AppleDesktop/ are stored in $localstatedir/netatalk/CNID
       (default: /var/netatalk/CNID), databases found in AFP volumes are
       automatically moved
* FIX: afpd: Server info packet was malformed resulting in broken
       server names being displayed on clients
* FIX: afpd: Byte order detection. Fixes an error where Netatalk on
       OpenIndiana returned wrong volume size information.

Changes in 3.0 alpha2
=====================

* UPD: afpd: Store '.' as is and '/' as ':' on the server, don't
       CAP hexencode as "2e" and "2f" respectively
* UPD: afdp: Automatic name conversion, renaming files and directories
       containing CAP sequences to their not enscaped forms
* UPD: afpd: Correct handling of user homes and users without homes

* UPD: dbd: -C option removes CAP encoding
* UPD: Add graceful option to RedHat init script
* UPD: Add --disable-bundled-libevent configure options When set to yes,
       we rely on a properly installed version on libevent CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS
       should be set properly to pick that up
* UPD: Run ldconfig on Linux at the end of make install
* FIX: afpd: ad cp on appledouble = ea volumes
* FIX: dbd: ignore ._ appledouble files
* REM: Volumes options "use dots" and "hex encoding"

Changes in 3.0 alpha1
=====================

* NEW: Central configuration file afp.conf which replaces all previous files
* NEW: netatalk: service controller starting and restarting afpd and cnid_metad
       as necessary
* NEW: afpd: Extended Attributes AppleDouble backend (default)
* UPD: CNID databases are stored in $localstatedir/netatalk/CNID
       (default: /var/netatalk/CNID), databases found in AFP volumes are
       automatically moved
* UPD: Start scripts and service manifests have been changed to only start
       the new netatalk service controller process
* UPD: afpd: UNIX privileges and use dots enabled by default

* UPD: afpd: Use GSS_C_NO_NAME as server principal when Kerberos options -fqdn
       and -krb5service are not set, from Jamie Gilbertson
* UPD: afpd: Changed behaviour for TimeMachine volumes in case there's a problem
       talking to the CNID daemons. Previously the volume was flagged read-only
       and an AFP message was sent to the client. As this might result in
       TimeMachine assuming the backup sparse bundle is damaged, we now just
       switch the CNID database to an in-memory tdb without the additional stuff.
* FIX: afpd: sendfile() on FreeBSD was broken, courtesy of Denis Ahrens
* FIX: afpd: Dont use searchdb when doing partial name search
* FIX: afpd: Fix a possible bug handling disconnected sessions,
       NetAFP Bug ID #16

* FIX: Zeroconf could not advertise non-ASCII time machine volume name

Changes in 2.2.2
================

* NEW: afpd: New option "adminauthuser". Specifying e.g. "-adminauthuser root"
       whenever a normal user login fails, afpd tries to authenticate as
       the specified adminauthuser. If this succeeds, a normal session is
       created for the original connecting user. Said differently: if you
       know the password of adminauthuser, you can authenticate as any other
       user.
* NEW: configure option "--enable-suse-systemd" for openSUSE12.1 and later.
       "--enable-redhat-systemd" and "--enable-suse-systemd" are same as
       "--enable-systemd".
       "--enable-suse" is renamed "--enable-suse-sysv".

* FIX: dbd: Better checking for duplicated or bogus CNIDs from AppleDouble
       files

       is crucial for the automatic BerkeleyDB database upgrade feature which
       is built into cnid_dbd and dbd.
* FIX: Fix compilation error when AppleTalk support is disabled
* FIX: Portability fixes
* FIX: search of surrogate pair

Changes in 2.2.1
================

* NEW: afpd: disable continous service feature by default, new option
       -keepsessions to enable it
* NEW: configure option "--enable-redhat-systemd" for Fedora15 and later.

* UPD: afpd: Enhance ACL support detection for volumes: enable them per volume
       if
       1) ACL support compiled in, 2) the volume supports ACLs, 3) the new
       volume option "noacls" is not set for the volume.
       The previous behaviour was to enable ACL support for a volume if
       1) it was compiled in and 2) the volume supported ACLs. There was no way
       to disable ACLs for a volume.
* UPD: afpd: add a configurable hold time option to FCE file modification event
       generation, default is 60 s, new option "fceholdfmod" to change it

====================

* UPD: afpd: new option "searchdb" which enables fast catalog searches
       using the CNID db.
* UPD: Case-insensitive fast search with the CNID db
* UPD: cnid_dbd: afpd now passes the volume path, not the db path when
       connecting for a volume. cnid_dbd will read the
       ".AppleDesktop/.volinfo" file of the volume in order to figure
       out the CNID db path and the volume charset encoding.

Changes in 2.2alpha4
====================

* NEW: Enhanced CNID "dbd" database for fast name search support.
       Important: this makes cnidscheme "cdb" incompatible with "dbd".

       directory service, by mapping ACLs to UARight
* UPD: afpd: performance improvements for ACL access calculations
* UPD: AppleTalk is disabled by default at configuration time. If needed
       use configure switch --enable-ddp.

================

* UPD: fallback to a temporary in memory tdb CNID database if the volume
       database can't be opened now works with the default backend "dbd" too.
* FIX: afpd: afp_ldap.conf was missing from tarball. This only effected
       [Open]Solaris.

* FIX: afpd: server signature wasn't initialized in some cases
* FIX: DESTDIR support: DESTDIR was expanded twice
* FIX: Fix for compilation error if header files of an older Netatalk
       version are installed.

Changes in 2.1-release
======================

* NEW: afpd: new volume option "volsizelimit" for limitting reported volume
       size. Useful for limitting TM backup size.

       after 2.1 in case of BerkeleyDB library updates, Netatalk
       will be able to upgrade the CNID databases.
* NEW: afpd: store and read CNIDs to/from AppleDouble files by default.
       This is used as a cache and as a backup in case the database
       is deleted or corrupted. It can be disabled with a new volume
       option "nocnidcache".
* NEW: afpd: sending SIGINT to a child afpd process enables debug logging
       to /tmp/afpd.PID.XXXXXX.
* NEW: configure args to download and install a "private" Webmin instance

       SRVLOC is legacy.
* UPD: cdb/dbd CNID backend requires BerkeleyDB >= 4.6
* UPD: afpd: default CNID backend is "dbd"
* UPD: afpd: try to install PAM config that pulls in system|common auth
* UPD: afpd: symlink handling: never followed server side, client resolves
       them, so it's safe to use them now.
* UPD: afpd: Comment out all extension->type/creator mappings in
       AppleVolumes.system. They're unmaintained, possibly wrong and
       do not fit for OS X.
* FIX: rewritten logger
* FIX: afpd: UNIX permissions handling
* FIX: cnid_dbd: always use BerkeleyDB transactions
* FIX: initscripts installation now correctly uses autoconf paths,
       i.e. they're installed to --sysconfdir.
* FIX: UTF-8 volume name length
* FIX: atalkd: workaround for broken Linux 2.6 AT kernel module:
       Linux 2.6 sends broadcast queries to the first available socket
       which is in our case the last configured one. atalkd now tries to
       find the right one.
       Note: now a misconfigured or plugged router can broadcast a wrong route !

Changes in 2.0-alpha1
=====================

* NEW: afpd: We now support AFP 3.x, which features long filenames and
       large file support
* NEW: CNID handling completely reworked. We now use per Volume configurable
       CNID backends.
* NEW: Two new daemons, cnid_metad and cnid_dbd to implement the dbd CNID backend.
       Using Berkeley DB transactions with the CNID database should be safe now.
* NEW: The on disk format of the CNID database has changed. We now support 8 byte
       device and inode numbers and an additinal type field that should make
       detection of file/directory changes outside of afpd more robust.
       Changed from HASH to BTREE access which speeds things up in certain cases
       and reduces database file size.
* NEW: Long file name mangling is now implemented using the CNID ID, so no database is
       required to map names to mangled names. This is the same method Mac OS X uses.
* NEW: New format (version 2) for Metadata in AppleDouble files. We record device and
       inode of the underlying file as well as the CNID. This can be used for recovery
       and speeds up access to the CNID.
* NEW: The old NLS codepage system has been removed. It was replaced by an iconv
       based conversion system, which provides much more flexibility.
* NEW: You can safely use extended characters in volume names and for SIGUSR2 messaging.
* NEW: The default volume encoding is UTF-8.
* NEW: All documentation is now generated using DocBook. New or completely reworked
       sections about installing, setting up and upgrading Netatalk replace various
       README files in the doc directory.
* FIX: Protect afpd better against unexpected signals during updates of the CNID
       database with the cdb backend. This makes database corruption less likely.
* FIX: All manpages have been reviewed and should now be up to date.
* FIX: Tons of bug fixes since 1.6.4. Please consults the CVS change log for details.

       supposed to!
* UPD: Code cleanups and compatibility fixes to macusers.

       file on the packagers system did not contain the necessary patch.
* FIX: On some systems, atalkd refuses to start, since it couldn't detect
       any interfaces. This was caused by an overzealous validity check.

Changes in 1.5rc2
=================

* FIX: contrib/shell_utils/lp2pap.sh was erased when "make clean" was called.
       Now we distribute lp2pap.sh.tmpl instead, and lp2pap.sh is automatically
       generated during package build.
* FIX: Some platforms (notably Tru64) don't have the snprintf() call, which
       was used in etc/afp/afp_config.c. This call was replaced by sprintf()
       and prior bounds checking.

*   Changed atalkd and the kernel driver to remove a hack added to
    support sending to 0.255.  Now the kernel will allow multiple open
    sockets with the same port, so long as the addess associated with
    the port is different.  atalkd now opens a socket for each port on
    each interface.

*   atalkd now rewrites its configuration file.  If no configuration
    file is given, one will be generated.  Permissions on the new
    configuration file will be inherited from the old one.  If there is
    no old one, permissions default to 644.  Won't rewrite the file if
    the owner doesn't have write permission.

*   Removed support for the "AFS Kerberos UAM", in favor of the
    "AuthMan UAM".  Kerberos support should now be much more
    straight-forward.

*   Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause incorrect group calculations
    on ultrix machines.

*   Fixed a bug in afpd which causes SimpleText and some other
    applications to silently fail to write.  There's also a bug in
    MacOS, but we can't fix that.

*   Fixed a bad interaction with afpd and AFS which would cause file
    writes to not propogate between AFS clients.

*   !!! CHANGED the name(s) of afpd's config files.  The new files are
    AppleVolumes.system and AppleVolumes.default.  If AppleVolumes.system
    exists, it is always read, AppleVolumes.default is only read if the
    user has no AppleVolumes file.  Included a flag "-u" to indicate
    which file has precedence.  "-u" user wins, otherwise ".system"
    wins.

*   Rewrote the AppleVolumes parsing code.  Now works.

*   Added a filename extension mapping to afpd.  User always takes
    precedence, regardless of the "-u" flag.  Code to change the type
    of all Unix files contributed by Kee Hinckley <nazgul@utopia.com>.

*   afpd now supports both UFS and AFS volumes simultaneously.  It also
    uses access() to attempt to calculate reasonable Mac permissions
    for AFS directories.

*   Changed reporting of file times.  Files that are written from Unix
    now update the Mac's idea of the files modification time.  Unix
    mtime is now reported instead of ctime.

*   Added support for a new UAM to afpd.  This requires that client
    Macs have MacTCP and AuthMan installed.  Should make running afpd
    for AFS easier.

*   Removed code so that otherwise valid volumes for which the mounting
    user has no permission will appear in the volume selection dialog
    on the Mac gray-ed out.

*   Added code from Chris Metcalf of MIT to the AppleDouble library
    which improves permission inheritance.

*   Added code from G. Paul Ziemba of Alantec, Inc to better report
    errors in psf.  Also changed psf to use syslog for errors that
    users aren't interested in.

*   Added information to psf's man page to better explain the
    interaction between psf, pap, and lpd.

*   Make psf/pap/psa do accounting when it's turnes on in
    /etc/printcap.

*   Changed pap's error message when there is no printer specified on
    the command line and no .paprc is found.  Also heavily modified
    pap's man page to reflect changes in the "new" version of pap,
    including moving it from section 8 to section 1.

*   Fixed a byte-order bug in pap's sequence numbers.  Doubt if pap has
    ever worked right on little endian machines!

*   Added a flag to pap to optionally close before receiving EOF from
    the printer.  Off by default.  psf calls pap with this option on.

*   Added timeouts to the nbp library calls.  This means that processes
    won't hang when atalkd dies during boot, thus hanging your
    machine.

Changes from the 1.3 release:
=============================

*   Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause APPL mappings to contain both
    mac and unix path names.  The fixed code will handle the old
    (corrupted) database.

*   Fixed a *very* serious bug which would cause files to be corrupted
    when copying to afpd.

*   Fixed a bug in afpd which would cause replies to icon writes to
    contain the written icon.

*   Filled in the function code switch in afpd.  Previously, a hacker
    could probably have used afpd to get unauthorized access to a
    machine running afpd.

*   Fixed a bug in the asp portion of libatalk.a which could cause the
    malloc()/free() database to be corrupted.

*   Fixed a bug in atalkd's zip query code.  With this bug, only the
    first N % 255 nets get queried.  However, since nets bigger than
    255 are usually pretty unstable, the unqueried for nets will
    eventually get done, when N drops by one.

*   Suppressed a spurious error ("route: No such process") in atalkd.

Changes from the 1.2.1 release:
===============================

*   atalkd is completely rewritten for phase 2 support.  atalkd.conf
    from previous version will not work!

*   afpd now has better AFS support.  In particular, the configuration
    for AFS was made much easier; a number of Kerberos-related
    byte-ordering and time problems were found; clear-text passwords
    were added (thanks to geeb@umich.edu).

*   afpd now handles Unix permissions much better (thanks to
    metcalf@mit.edu).

*   There are many, many more changes, but most are small bug fixes.

Changes from the 1.2 release:
=============================

*   The Sun support now uses loadable kernel modules (a la VDDRV)
    instead of binary patches. As such, it should work on any sunos
    greater than 4.1, and is confirmed to work under 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.

*   The DEC support no longer requires source. It also runs under
    ultrix 4.1 and 4.2. It still requires patching your kernel, but the
    patches are limited to those files available to binary-only sites
    -- primarily hooks for things like netatalk.

*   The etc.rc script now uses changes made to nbprgstr (see below).

*   aecho now takes machine names on the command line.

*   nbplkup now takes a command line argument specifying the number of
    responses to accept. It also takes its defaults from the NBPLKUP
    environment variable.

*   nbprgstr may be used to register a name at any requested port.

*   afpd now logs if an illegal shell is used during login, instead of
    silently denying service.

*   A bug in afpd which caused position information for the directory
    children of the root of a volume to be ignored has been fixed.

*   Several typos in afpd which would cause include files necessary to
    ultrix to be skipped have been fixed.

*   atalkd will no long propagate routes to networks whose zone
    it doesn't know.

*   atalkd no longer dumps core if it receives a ZIP GetMyZone request
    from a network whose zone it doesn't know. (Since this currently
    can only happen from off net, it's not precisely a legal request.)

*   pap and papd (optionally) no longer check the connection id in PAP
    DATA responses. Both also maintain the function code in non-first-packet
    PAP DATA responses.  These changes are work-arounds to deal with
    certain AppleTalk printer cards, notably the BridgePort LocalTalk
    card for HP LJIIISIs.

*   pap no longer sends an EOF response to each PAP SENDDATA request,
    only the first.

*   A bug in papd which would cause it to return a random value when
    printing the procset to a piped printer has been fixed.

*   A bug relating to NBP on reverse-endian machines has been fixed.

*   atp_rsel() from libatalk now returns a correct value even if it
    hasn't recieved anything yet.

*   atalk_addr() from libatalk no longer accepts addresses in octal
    format, since AppleTalk addresses can have leading zeros. Also it
    checks that the separator character is a '.'.

*   Pseudo man pages for nbplkup, nbprgstr, and nbpunrgstr, have been
    added.

*   The example in the psf(8) man page is now correct.

*   The man pages for changed commands have been updated.

*   The README files for various machine have been updated
    appropriately.
