This is the README file for timelord 1.0 (previously known as
ntimelord), for use with netatalk 1.5. Previous versions of this
software were designed to work with netatalk 1.3, but this has
been patched to work with netatalk 1.5.  Please see the COPYRIGHT
file.  This package's COPYRIGHT is *not* the same as netatalk's.

Building timelord:

1.  Run ./configure from the base directory of your netatalk
    distribution, and add --enable-timelord to your command line
    options.

2.  Run "make all" for netatalk, and timelord will be built along
    with the rest of netatalk.

Installing timelord:

1.  To install the binaries, type "make install" from either the base
    directory of your netatalk distribution or from this directory. 
    This will install all of the binaries in the directory specified
    by ./configure.

2.  The file rc.atalk as distributed with netatalk 1.5 includes lines to
    start timelord.
