ABOUT MACIPGW
=============

This is macipgw, a MacIP gateway for *BSD and Linux.

MacIP is a protocol that allows the encapsulation of IP packets in AppleTalk
packets, thus allowing Macs connected through an AppleTalk-only network
(such as LocalTalk or Apple Remote Access) to use TCP/IP-based services.

On *BSD, you will need one tunnel device for macipgw.  See tun(4) for details.

It has been included in the netatalk project with his blessing.
