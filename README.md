# About Netatalk
Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source fileserver that implements the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) 3.4.
AFP was the primary file sharing protocol for Apple Macintosh and Apple II computers from 1987 to 2013.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server.

# Why Should I Use Netatalk?
If you're running a network of older Macs, in particular those running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or earlier, all the way back to Classic Mac OS,
are well served by running a Netatalk AppleShare server. The latest macOS at the time of writing (macOS 13 Ventura) still comes with an AFP client,
so Netatalk can act as a seamless bridge between new and old Macs.

Compared to other Open Source file sharing solutions such as NFS or Samba, Netatalk delivers high transfer speeds and full integration
of classic Mac OS metadata (resource forks) as well as a wide range of UAMs for user authentication.
