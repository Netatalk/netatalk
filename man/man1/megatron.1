.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmegatron\fR
is used to transform files from BinHex, MacBinary, AppleSingle, or
\fBnetatalk\fR
style AppleDouble formats into MacBinary or
\fBnetatalk\fR
style AppleDouble formats\&. The
\fBnetatalk\fR
style AppleDouble format is the file format used by
\fBafpd,\fR
the
\fBnetatalk\fR
Apple Filing Protocol (AppleShare) server\&. BinHex, MacBinary, and AppleSingle are commonly used formats for transferring Macintosh files between machines via email or file transfer protocols\&.
\fBmegatron\fR
uses its name to determine what type of tranformation is being asked of it\&.
.PP
If
\fBmegatron\fR
is called as
\fBunhex\fR
,
\fBunbin\fR
or
\fBunsingle\fR, it tries to convert file(s) from BinHex, MacBinary, or AppleSingle into AppleDouble format\&. BinHex is the format most often used to send Macintosh files by e\-mail\&. Usually these files have an extension of "\&.hqx"\&. MacBinary is the format most often used by terminal emulators "on the fly" when transferring Macintosh files in binary mode\&. MacBinary files often have an extension of "\&.bin"\&. Some Macintosh LAN\-based email packages use uuencoded AppleSingle format to "attach" or "enclose" files in email\&. AppleSingle files don\'t have a standard filename extension\&.
.PP
If
\fBmegatron\fR
is called as
\fBhqx2bin\fR,
\fBsingle2bin\fR, or
\fBmacbinary\fR, it will try to convert the file(s) from BinHex, AppleSingle, or AppleDouble into MacBinary\&. This last translation may be useful in moving Macintosh files from your
\fBafpd\fR
server to some other machine when you can\'t copy them from the server using a Macintosh for some reason\&.
.PP
If
\fBmegatron\fR
is called with any other name, it uses the default translation, namely
\fBunhex\fR\&.
.PP
If no source file is given, or if
\fIsourcefile\fR
is `\fB\-\fR\', and if the conversion is from a BinHex or MacBinary file,
\fBmegatron\fR
will read from standard input\&.
.PP
The filename used to store any output file is the filename that is encoded in the source file\&. MacBinary files are created with a "\&.bin" extension\&. In the case of conflicts, the old file is overwritten!
