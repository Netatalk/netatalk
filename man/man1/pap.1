.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pap
is used to connect and send files to an AppleTalk connected printer using
the Apple Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
When
.B pap
starts execution, it
tries to open a session with the printer using PAP, and
then downloads the
.I files
to the printer.
.LP
If no
.I files
are given on the command line,
.B pap
begins reading from standard input.
.LP
If no printer is specified on the command line,
.B pap
looks for a file called
.B .paprc
in the current working directory and reads it to obtain the
.I nbpname
of a
printer.
Blank lines and lines that begin with a
.RB ` # '
are ignored.
.I type
and
.I zone
default to
.B LaserWriter
and the zone of the local host, respectively.
.LP
Note that
.B pap
is designed to be useful as a communication filter for sending
.BR lpd (8)
spooled print jobs to AppleTalk connected printers.  See
.BR psf (8)
for hints on how to use it this way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c
Take cuts.  Normally
.B pap
tells the printer how long it has been waiting.  When
.B -c
is specified,
.B pap
claims to have been waiting forever.
.TP
.B -e
Send any message from the printer to stderr instead of stdout.
.BR psf (8)
invokes
.B pap
with this option.
.HP
.B -p
.I nbpname
.br
Connect to the printer named
.I nbpname
and do not consult the
.B .paprc
file to find a printer name.  See
.BR nbp_name (3)
for the syntax of
.IR nbpname .
.HP
.B -s
.I statusfile
.br
Update the file called
.I statusfile
to contain the most recent status message from the printer.
.B pap
gets the status from the printer when it is waiting for the printer to
process input.  The
.I statusfile
will contain a single line terminated with a newline.  This is useful
when
.B pap
is invoked by
.BR psf (8)
within
.BR lpd 's
spool directory.
.SH FILES
