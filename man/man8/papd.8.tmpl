.SH NAME
papd \- AppleTalk print server daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpapd\fR [\-d] [\-f configfile] [\-p printcap]
.SH DESCRIPTION
papd is the AppleTalk printer daemon. This daemon
accepts print jobs from AppleTalk clients (typically Macintosh computers)
using the Printer Access Protocol (PAP). When used with System V printing
systems, papd spools jobs directly into an
\fBlpd\fR(8) spool directory and wakes up lpd
after accepting a job from the network to have it re\-examine the
appropriate spool directory. The actual printing and spooling is handled
entirely by lpd.
.PP
papd can also pipe the print job to an external
program for processing, and this is the preferred method on systems not
using CUPS to avoid compatibility problems with all the flavours of
lpd in use.
.PP
As of version 2.0, CUPS is also supported. Simply using \fIcupsautoadd\fR as first papd.conf entry will share all
CUPS printers automagically using the PPD files configured in CUPS. It ist
still possible to overwrite these defaults by individually define printer
shares. See \fBpapd.conf\fR(5) for details.
.PP
papd is typically started at boot time, out of
system init scripts. It first reads from its configuration file,
\fB:ETCDIR:/papd.conf\fR. The file is in the same format as
\fB/etc/printcap\fR. See \fBprintcap\fR(5) for details. The name of the entry is registered with
NBP.

If no configuration file is given, the hostname of the

.SH OPTIONS

\-d
Do not fork or disassociate from the terminal. Write some
debugging information to stderr.
.TP 
\-f \fIconfigfile\fR
Consult \fIconfigfile\fR instead of
\fB:ETCDIR:/papd.conf\fR for the configuration
information.
.TP 
\-p \fIprintcap\fR
Consult \fIprintcap\fR instead of
\fB/etc/printcap\fR for LPD configuration
information.
.SH NOTES
PSSP (Print Server Security Protocol) is an authentication
protocol carried out through postscript printer queries to the print
server. Using PSSP requires LaserWriter 8.6.1 or greater on the client
mac. The user will be prompted to enter their username and password before
they print. It may be necessary to re\-setup the printer on each client the
first time PSSP is enabled, so that the client can figure out that
authentication is required to print. You can enable PSSP on a per\-printer
basis. PSSP is the recommended method of authenticating printers as it is
more robust than CAP\-style authentication, described below.
.PP
CAP\-style authentication gets its name from the method the CAP (Columbia APpletalk)
package used to authenticate its mac clients' printing. This method
requires that a user login to a file share before they print.
afpd records the username in a temporary file named
after the client's Appletalk address, and it deletes the temporary file
when the user disconnects. Therefore CAP style authentification will
\fInot\fR work for clients connected to
afpd via TCP/IP. papd gets the
username from the file with the same Appletalk address as the machine
connecting to it. CAP\-style authentication will work with any mac client.
If both CAP and PSSP are enabled for a particular printer, CAP will be
tried first, then papd will fall back to PSSP.
.PP
The list of UAMs to use for authentication (specified with the 'am' option)
applies to all printers. It is not possible to define different
authentication methods on each printer. You can specify the list of UAMS
multiple times, but only the last setting will be used. Currently only
uams_guest.so and uams_clrtxt.so are supported as printer authentication
methods. The guest method requires a valid username, but not a password.
The Cleartext UAM requires both a valid username and the correct
password.
.RS 
\fBNote\fR
.PP
As of this writing, Mac OS X makes no use of PSSP authentication
any longer. CAP\-style authentication normally won't be an option, too
caused by the use of AFP over TCP these days.

\fB\&.ppd\fR
PostScript Printer Description file. papd answers
configuration and font queries from printing clients by consulting
the configured PPD file. Such files are available for download from
Adobe, Inc. (http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.htm),
or from the printer's manufacturer. If no PPD file is configured,
papd will return the default answer, possibly causing the client to
send excessively large jobs.
.SH CAVEATS
papd accepts characters with the high bit set (a
full 8\-bits) from the clients, but some PostScript printers (including
Apple Computer's LaserWriter family) only accept 7\-bit characters on their
serial interface by default. The same applies for some printers when
they're accessed via TCP/IP methods (remote LPR or socket). You will need
to configure your printer to accept a full 8 bits or take special
precautions and convert the printjob's encoding (eg. by using \fIco="protocol=BCP"\fR when using CUPS 1.1.19 or
above).
.PP
When printing clients run MacOS 10.2 or above, take care that PPDs
do not make use of \fI*cupsFilter:\fR comments
unless the appropriate filters are installed at the client's side, too
(remember: Starting with 10.2 Apple chose to integrate CUPS into MacOS X).
For in\-depth information on how CUPS uses PPDs see chapter 3.4 in http://tinyurl.com/zbxn).
