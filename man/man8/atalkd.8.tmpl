.TH atalkd 8 "06 Sep 2004" 2.0.0 Netatalk 
.SH NAME
atalkd \- AppleTalk RTMP, NBP, ZIP, and AEP manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBatalkd\fR [\-f \fBconfigfile\fR] [\-1] [\-2]
.SH DESCRIPTION
atalkd is responsible for all user level
AppleTalk network management. This includes routing, name registration and
lookup, zone lookup, and the AppleTalk Echo Protocol (similar to
\fBping\fR(8)). atalkd is typically started at boot
time, out of \fB/etc/rc\fR. It first reads from its
configuration file, \fB:ETCDIR:/atalkd.conf\fR. If there is
no configuration file, atalkd will attempt to configure
all available interfaces and will create a configuration file. The file
consists of a series of interfaces, one per line. Lines with `#' in the
first column are ignored, as are blank lines. The syntax is
.PP
\fIinterface\fR [ \fB\-seed\fR ]
[ \fB\-phase\fR \fInumber\fR ] [
\fB\-net\fR \fInet\-range\fR ] [
\fB\-addr\fR \fIaddress\fR ] [
\fB\-zone\fR \fIzonename\fR ] ...
.PP
Note that all fields except the interface are optional. The loopback
interface is configured automatically. If \fB\-seed\fR is
specified, all other fields must be present. Also,
atalkd will exit during bootstrap\%ping, if a router
disagrees with its seed information. If \fB\-seed\fR is not
given, all other information may be overriden during auto\-configuration.
If no \fB\-phase\fR option is given, the default phase as given
on the command line is used (the default is 2). If \fB\-addr\fR
is given and \fB\-net\fR is not, a net\-range of one is
assumed.
.PP
The first \-zone directive for each interface is the ``default''
zone. Under Phase 1, there is only one zone. Under Phase 2, all routers on
the network are configured with the default zone and must agree.
atalkd maps ``*'' to the default zone of the first
interface. Note: The default zone for a machine is determined by the
configuration of the local routers; to appear in a non\-default zone, each
service, e.g. afpd, must individually specify the
desired zone. See also \fBnbp_name\fR(3).
.SH ROUTING
If you are connecting a netatalk router to an existing AppleTalk
internet, you should first contact your local network administrators to
obtain appropriate network addresses.
.PP
atalkd can provide routing between interfaces by
configuring multiple interfaces. Each interface must be assigned a unique
net\-range between 1 and 65279 (0 and 65535 are illegal, and addresses
between 65280 and 65534 are reserved for startup). It is best to choose
the smallest useful net\-range, i.e. if you have three machines on an
Ethernet, don't chose a net\-range of 1000\-2000. Each net\-range may have an
arbitrary list of zones associated with it.
.SH EXAMPLES
Below is an example configuration file for a sun4/40. The machine
has two interfaces, ``le0'' and ``le1''. The ``le0'' interface is
configured automatically from other routers on the network. The machine is
the only router for the ``le1'' interface.
.PP
.nf

atalkd
automatically acts as a router if there is more than one interface.
.SH FILES

.SH BUGS
On some systems, atalkd can not be
restarted.
