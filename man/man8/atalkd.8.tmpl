.SH "NAME"
atalkd \- AppleTalk RTMP, NBP, ZIP, and AEP manager

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBatalkd\fR
is responsible for all user level AppleTalk network management\&. This includes routing, name registration and lookup, zone lookup, and the AppleTalk Echo Protocol (similar to
\fBping\fR(8))\&.
\fBatalkd\fR
is typically started at boot time from system init scripts or services\&. It first reads from its configuration file,
:ETCDIR:/atalkd\&.conf\&. If there is no configuration file,
\fBatalkd\fR
will attempt to configure all available interfaces and will create a configuration file\&. The file consists of a series of interfaces, one per line\&. Lines with `#\*(Aq in the first column are ignored, as are blank lines\&. The syntax is
.PP
\fIinterface\fR
[
\fB\-seed\fR
] [
\fB\-phase\fR
\fInumber\fR
] [
\fB\-net\fR
\fInet\-range\fR
] [
\fB\-addr\fR
\fIaddress\fR
] [
\fB\-zone\fR
\fIzonename\fR
] \&.\&.\&.
.PP
Note that all fields except the interface are optional\&. The loopback interface is configured automatically\&. If
\fB\-seed\fR
is specified, all other fields must be present\&. Also,
\fBatalkd\fR
will exit during bootstrap\%ping, if a router disagrees with its seed information\&. If
\fB\-seed\fR
is not given, all other information may be overridden during auto\-configuration\&. If no
\fB\-phase\fR
option is given, the default phase as given on the command line is used (the default is 2)\&. If
\fB\-addr\fR
is given and
\fB\-net\fR
is not, a net\-range of one is assumed\&.
.PP
The first \-zone directive for each interface is the ``default\*(Aq\*(Aq zone\&. Under Phase 1, there is only one zone\&. Under Phase 2, all routers on the network are configured with the default zone and must agree\&.
\fBatalkd\fR
maps ``*\*(Aq\*(Aq to the default zone of the first interface\&. Note: The default zone for a machine is determined by the configuration of the local routers; to appear in a non\-default zone, each service, e\&.g\&.
\fBafpd\fR, must individually specify the desired zone\&. See also
\fBnbp_name\fR(3)\&.
.SH "ROUTING"
.PP
If you are connecting a netatalk router to an existing AppleTalk network, you should first contact your local network administrators to obtain appropriate network addresses\&.
.PP
\fBatalkd\fR
can provide routing between interfaces by configuring multiple interfaces\&. Each interface must be assigned a unique net\-range
between 1 and 65279 (0 and 65535 are illegal, and addresses between 65280 and 65534 are reserved for startup)\&. It is best to choose the smallest useful net\-range, i\&.e\&. if you have three machines on a LAN, don\*(Aqt chose a net\-range of 1000\-2000\&. Each net\-range may have an arbitrary list of zones associated with it\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Below is an example configuration file for a sun4/40\&. The machine has two interfaces, ``le0\*(Aq\*(Aq and ``le1\*(Aq\*(Aq\&. The ``le0\*(Aq\*(Aq interface is configured automatically from other routers on the network\&. The machine is the only router for the ``le1\*(Aq\*(Aq interface\&.
