.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBafpd\fR
provides an AppleTalk Filing Protocol (AFP) interface to the Unix file system\&. It is normally started at boot time from /etc/rc\&.
.PP
The list of volumes offered to the user is generated from
:ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes\&.system
and one of
:ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes\&.default,
~/AppleVolumes, or
~/\&.AppleVolumes\&. The
AppleVolumes
files is used to specify volumes to mount and file name extension mappings\&. It is formatted as follows, one specification per line: pathname [ volumename ] \&.extension [ type [ creator ] ] If volumename is unspecified, the last component of pathname is used\&. No two volumes may have the same name\&. The extension \'\&.\' sets the default creator and type for otherwise untyped Unix files\&. Blank lines and lines beginning with `#\' are ignored\&.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Specifies that the daemon should not fork\&. If netatalk has been configured with
\fI\-\-enable\-debug1\fR, a trace of all AFP commands will be written to stdout\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Prevents clients from saving their passwords\&. (Equivalent to \-\fBnosavepasswd\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Allows clients to change their passwords\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-setpasswd\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
Use DDP (AppleTalk) as transport protocol\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-ddp\fR
in
afpd\&.cond\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-T
.RS 4
Use TCP/IP as transport protocol\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-tcp\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Print version information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Print verbose information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Print help and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I
.RS 4
Use a platform specific icon\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-icon\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.) (Recent Mac OS don\'t display it\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIdefaultvolumes\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that
\fIdefaultvolumes\fR
should be read for a list of default volumes to offer, instead of
:ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes\&.default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s \fIsystemvolumes\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that
\fIsystemvolumes\fR
should be read for a list of volume that all users will be offered, instead of
:ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes\&.system\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Read the user\'s
AppleVolumes
file first\&. This option causes volume names in the user\'s
AppleVolumes
file to override volume names in the system\'s
AppleVolumes
file\&. The default is to read the system
AppleVolumes
file first\&. Note that this option doesn\'t effect the precendence of filename extension mappings: the user\'s
AppleVolumes
file always has precedence\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n \fInbpname\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that
\fInbpname\fR
should be used for NBP registration, instead of the first component of the hostname in the local zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fImaxconnections\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum number of connections to allow for this
\fBafpd\fR\&. The default is 20\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g \fIguest\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the name of the guest account\&. The default is \'\fInobody\fR\'\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P \fIpidfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the file in which
\fBafpd\fR
stores its process id\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S \fIport\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the port to register with when doing AFPoverTCP\&. Defaults to 548\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-port \fRin
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-L \fImessage\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the login message that will be sent to clients\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-loginmsg\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-F \fIconfigfile\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the configuration file to use\&. (Defaults to
:ETCDIR:/netatalk/afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-U \fIuams\fR
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of UAMs to use for the authentication process\&. (Equivalent to
\fB\-uamlist\fR
in
afpd\&.conf\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-m \fIumask\fR
.RS 4
Use this
\fIumask\fR
for the creation of folders in Netatalk\&.
.RE
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
Signals that are sent to the main
\fBafpd\fR
process are propagated to the children, so all will be affected\&.
.PP
SIGHUP
.RS 4
Sending a
\fBSIGHUP\fR
to afpd will cause it to reload its configuration files\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGINT
.RS 4
Sending a
\fBSIGINT\fR
to a child
\fBafpd\fR
enables
\fImax_debug\fR
logging for this process\&. The log is sent to fhe file
/tmp/afpd\&.PID\&.XXXXXX\&. Sending another
\fBSIGINT\fR
will terminate the process\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGUSR1
.RS 4
The
\fBafpd\fR
process will send the message "The server is going down for maintenance\&." to the client and shut itself down in 5 minutes\&. New connections are not allowed\&. If this is sent to a child afpd, the other children are not affected\&. However, the main process will still exit, disabling all new connections\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGUSR2
.RS 4
The
\fBafpd\fR
process will look in the message directory configured at build time for a file named message\&.pid\&. For each one found, a the contents will be sent as a message to the associated AFP client\&. The file is removed after the message is sent\&. This should only be sent to a child
\fBafpd\fR\&.
.sp
To shut down a user\'s
\fBafpd\fR
process it is recommended that
\fBSIGKILL (\-9)\fR
\fINOT\fR
be used, except as a last resort, as this may leave the CNID database in an inconsistent state\&. The safe way to terminate an
\fBafpd\fR
is to send it a
\fBSIGTERM (\-15)\fR
signal and wait for it to die on its own\&.
