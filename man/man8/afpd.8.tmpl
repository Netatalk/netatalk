.SH DESCRIPTION
.B afpd
provides an AppleTalk Filing Protocol (AFP)
interface to the Unix file system.  It is normally started at boot time
from
.BR /etc/rc .
The list of volumes offered to the user is generated from
.B :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.system
and one of
.BR :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.default ,
.BR ~/AppleVolumes ,
or
.BR ~/.AppleVolumes .
.LP
The
.B AppleVolumes
files is used to specify volumes to mount and file name extension mappings.
It is formatted as follows, one specification per line:
.RS
.sp
.I pathname
[
.I volumename
]
.br
.RI . extension
[
.I type
[
.I creator
]
]
.sp
.RE
If
.I volumename
is unspecified, the last component of
.I pathname
is used.  No two volumes may have the same name.  If
.I type
is unspecified
.RB ' ???? '
is used.  If
.I creator
is unspecified
.RB ' UNIX '
is used.  The extension
.RB ' . '
sets the default creator and type for otherwise untyped Unix files.
Blank lines and lines beginning with `#' are ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Specifies that the daemon not fork, and that a trace of all AFP
commands be written to stdout.
.TP
.BI \-f " defaultvolumes"
Specifies that
.I defaultvolumes
should be read for a list of default volumes to offer, instead of
.BR :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.default .
.TP
.BI \-s " systemvolumes"
Specifies that
.I systemvolumes
should be read for a list of volume that all users will be offered,
instead of
.BR :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.system .
.TP
.B \-u
Read the user's
.B AppleVolumes
file first.  This option causes volume names in the user's
.B AppleVolumes
file to override volume names in the system's
.B AppleVolumes
file.  The default is to read the system
.B AppleVolumes
file first.  Note that this option doesn't effect the precendence of
filename extension mappings: the user's AppleVolumes file always has
precedence.
.TP
.BI \-n " nbpname"
Specifies that
.I nbpname
should be used for NBP registration, instead of the first component of
the hostname in the local zone.
.TP
.BI \-c " maxconnections"
Specifies the maximum number of connections to allow for this
.BR afpd .
The default is 5.
.TP
.BI \-g " guest"
Specifies the name of the guest account.  The default is ``nobody''.
.TP
.BI \-P " pidfile"
Specifies the file in which
.B afpd
stores its process id.
.TP
.B \-p
Prevents clients from saving their passwords. (Equivalent to
.I \-nosavepasswd
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.B \-t
Allows clients to change their passwords. (Equivalent to
.I \-setpasswd
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.B \-D
Use DDP (AppleTalk) as transport protocol. (Equivalent to
.I \-ddp
in
.BR afpd.cond .)
.TP
.B \-T
Use TCP/IP as transport protocol. (Equivalent to
.I \-tcp
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.BI \-S " port"
Specifies the port to register with when doing AFPoverTCP. Defaults to
.IR 548 .
(Equivalent to
.I -port
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.BI \-L " message"
Specifies the login message that will be sent to clients. (Equivalent to
.I \-loginmsg
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.BI \-F " config"
Specifies the configuration file to use. (Defaults to
.IR :ETCDIR:/afpd.conf .)
.TP
.BI \-U " uams"
Comma-separated list of UAMs to use for the authentication process.
(Equivalent to
.I -uamlist
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.B \-I
Use a platform specific icon. (Equivalent to
.I \-icon
in
.BR afpd.conf .)
.TP
.BR \-m " umask"
Use this umask for the creation of folders in Netatalk.
.TP
.B \-v
Print version information and exit.
.SH AUTHENTICATION
.B afpd
currently understands three User Authentication Methods (UAMs):
.BR NoUserAuthent ,
or guest,
.B Cleartxt
.BR passwrd ,
and
.B Kerberos
.BR IV .
If a user uses
.BR NoUserAuthent ,
s/he will only be offered default volumes to mount, and will only be able
to read and write files that are permitted to the guest user.  The
.B -G
option disables
.BR NoUserAuthent .
With
.B Cleartxt passwd
and
.B Kerberos
.BR IV ,
.B afpd
offers the user all volumes listed in
.BR ~/AppleVolumes .
The user may also read and write all files that s/he normally could.
.B Cleartxt passwd
is not recommended for AFS use.
.B Kerberos IV
is recommended for AFS use.
A forth, depricated UAM is also included in the distribution,
.B AFS
.BR Kerberos .
.SH CAVEATS
.BR afpd 's
Directory IDs are only fixed for the duration of a session.  This means
that Mac aliases won't work correctly in all cases.
.LP
If a user renames a folder that has an application as its progeny, the
.B APPL
mapping for the application will not longer be available. This implies
that double-clicking on one of the application's documents will no
longer launch the application. The
.B APPL
mapping will be rebuilt by the mac, the next time the Finder see the
application.
.LP
If
.B afpd
is configured to downcase Macintosh filenames, Unix filenames with
mixed case will be unavailable.
.LP
If carriage return/line feed translation is enabled, it is not
safe to copy Unix binaries to a Macintosh.
.LP
It is not possible to move directories between devices.
.LP
When mounting the parent of an existing volume, the desktop database of
the existing volume will not be available to the parent volume.  The
.B APPL
mappings and icons of applications with the
.B BNDL
bit set will be generated in the parent volume as the applications are
seen by the Finder.
.LP
If a user edits his
.B ~/AppleVolumes
so that his home directory is no longer offered, he will no longer be able
to edit his
.B ~/AppleVolumes
from the Macintosh.
.LP
Unix files beginning with `.' are not accessible from the mac.
.LP
If the
.I pathname
in an
.B ~/AppleVolumes
file does not exist, the volume will not be offered in the Chooser.
.LP
Microsoft Word
.B TEXT
documents do not get carriage return/line feed translation.  This is
because MS Word uses a type other than
.B TEXT
while writing the document, then changes the type to
.BR TEXT .
To allow users to edit their
.BR ~/AppleVolumes ,
.B afpd
parses the files with either end of line character.
.LP
Unix filenames that are longer than 31 characters are inaccessible from
the Macintosh.

.SH SIGNALS
Signals that are sent to the main
.B afpd
process are propagated to the children, so all will be affected.
.TP 13
.B SIGHUP
The
.B afpd
process will send the message "The server is going down for maintenance."
to the client and shut itself down in 5 minutes.  New connections are not
allowed.  If this is sent to a child
.BR afpd ,
the other children are not affected.  However, the main process will still
exit, disabling all new connections.
.TP 13
.B SIGUSR1
If the
.B --with-message-dir
configure option was used, the
.B afpd
process will set the
.B debug
option and redirect the messages to
.RI /var/tmp/afpd-debug- pid .
This should only be sent to a child
.BR afpd .
.B Warning:
If the
.B --with-message-dir
option was not used, this will kill the
.B afpd
process.

.TP 13
.B SIGUSR2
The
.B afpd
process will look in the
.I msg
directory for a file named
.RI message. pid .
For each one found, a the contents will be sent as a message to the
associated AFP client.  The file is removed after the message is sent.

.SH FILES
.TP 20
.B :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.default
list of default volumes to mount
.TP 20
.B :ETCDIR:/AppleVolumes.system
list of volumes to offer all users
.TP 20
.B ~/AppleVolumes
user's list of volumes to mount
.TP 20
.BI :ETCDIR:/msg/message. pid
contains messages to be sent to users.
.TP 20
.BI /var/tmp/afpd-debug- pid
contains debug output, if triggered.
.SH BUGS
A few calls from the AFP specification are not implemented, because the
Macintosh does not use them.
