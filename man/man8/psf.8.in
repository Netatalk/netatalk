.SH "NAME"
psf \- PostScript filter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpsf\fR\fB\fR\ 'u
\fBpsf\fR\fB\fR [\-n\ \fIname\fR] [\-h\ \fIhost\fR] [\-w\ \fIwidth\fR] [\-l\ \fIlength\fR] [\-i\ \fIindent\fR] [\-c]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpsf\fR
is an
\fBlpd\fR
filter for PostScript printing\&.
\fBpsf\fR
interprets the name it was called with to determine what filters to invoke\&. First, if the string ``pap\*(Aq\*(Aq appears anywhere in the name,
\fBpsf\fR
invokes
\fBpap\fR
to talk to a printer via AppleTalk\&. Next, if the string ``rev\*(Aq\*(Aq appears,
\fBpsf\fR
invokes
\fBpsorder\fR
to reverse the pages of the job\&. Finally, if
\fBpsf\fR
was called with a filter\*(Aqs name as the leading string, it invokes that filter\&. If there is no filter to run,
\fBpsf\fR
examines the magic number of the input, and if the input is not PostScript, converts it to PostScript\&.
.SH "KLUDGE"
.PP
In the default configuration,
\fBpsf\fR
supports two kludges\&. The first causes
\fBpsf\fR
to check its name for the letter `m\*(Aq\&. If this letter is found and accounting is turned on,
\fBpsf\fR
calls
\fBpap\fR
twice, once to get an initial page count and to print the job, and another time to get a final page count\&. This is a work\-around for bugs in a variety of PAP implementions that cause printers to never properly close the PAP output file\&. A notable example is any printer by Hewlett\-Packard\&.
.PP
The second kludge causes
\fBpsf\fR
to examine its name for the letter `w\*(Aq\&. If this letter is found and accounting is turned on,
\fBpsf\fR
calls
\fBpap\fR
with the
\fB\-w\fR
flag\&. This flag causes
\fBpap\fR
to wait until the printer\*(Aqs status contains the string `idle\*(Aq\&. Once this string is found, the job is printed as normal\&. This kludge is a work\-around for printers, notably Hewlett\-Packard\*(Aqs LaserJet IV, which will report a page count while a previous jobs is still printing\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
The sample
\fBprintcap\fR
entry below invokes
\fBpsf\fR
to print text files, PostScript files,
\fBtroff\fR\*(Aqs C/A/T output, and
\fBTeX\fR\*(Aqs DVI output, to an AppleTalk connected LaserWriter Plus\&. Since the LaserWriter Plus stacks pages in descending order, we reverse the pages and print the burst page last\&.

.PP
Note that if the host in question spools to more than one AppleTalk printer,
/dev/null
should not be used for the
\fBlp\fR
capability\&. Instead, a null device should be created with
\fBmknod\fR
for each printer, as has been done above\&.
.PP
Finally, there is a file in the spool directory,
/var/spool/lpd/laser, called
\fB\&.paprc\fR, which
\fBpap\fR
reads for the AppleTalk name of the printer\&.
