.SH NAME
atalk_aton \- AppleTalk address parsing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <netatalk/at.h>

\fIatalk_aton\fR(char * \fIcp\fR, struct at_addr * \fIata\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The atalk_aton() routine converts an ASCII
representation of an AppleTalk address to a format appropriate for system
calls. Acceptable ASCII representations include both hex and base 10, in
triples or doubles. For instance, the address `0x1f6b.77' has a
network part of `8043' and a node part of `119'. This same address
could be written `8043.119', `31.107.119', or `0x1f.6b.77'. If
the address is in hex and the first digit is one of `A\-F', a leading
`0x' is redundant.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBatalk\fR(4).
