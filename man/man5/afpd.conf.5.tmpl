afpd.conf \- Configuration file used by afpd(8) to determine the setup of its file sharing services

.PP
:ETCDIR:/afpd\&.conf
is the configuration file used by

to determine the behavior and configuration of the different virtual file servers that it provides\&.
.PP
Any line not prefixed with # is interpreted\&. The configuration lines are composed like: server name [ options ] If a

.RE
.SH "CODEPAGE OPTIONS"
.PP
With OS X Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol\&. One of the big changes was, that AFP3 uses Unicode names encoded as Decomposed UTF\-8 (UTF8\-MAC)\&. Previous AFP/OS versions used codepages like MacRoman, MacCentralEurope, etc\&.
.PP
To be able to serve AFP3 and older clients at the same time,
\fBafpd\fR
needs to be able to convert between UTF\-8 and Mac codepages\&. Even OS X clients partly still rely on codepages\&. As there\'s no way,
\fBafpd\fR
can detect the codepage a pre AFP3 client uses, you have to specify it using the
\fB\-maccodepage\fR
option\&. The default is MacRoman, which should be fine for most western users\&.
.PP
As
\fBafpd\fR
needs to interact with unix operating system as well, it need\'s to be able to convert from UTF8\-MAC/MacCodepage to the unix codepage\&. By default
\fBafpd\fR
uses the systems LOCALE, or ASCII if your system doesn\'t support locales\&. You can set the unix codepage using the
\fB\-unixcodepage\fR
option\&. If you\'re using extended characters in the configuration files for
\fBafpd\fR, make sure your terminal matches the
\fB\-unixcodepage\fR\&.
.PP
\-unixcodepage [\fICODEPAGE\fR]
.RS 4
Specifies the servers unix codepage, e\&.g\&. "ISO\-8859\-15" or "UTF8"\&. This is used to convert strings to/from the systems locale, e\&.g\&. for authenthication, server messages and volume names\&. Defaults to LOCALE if your system supports it, otherwise ASCII will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-maccodepage [\fICODEPAGE\fR]
.RS 4
Specifies the mac clients codepage, e\&.g\&. "MAC_ROMAN"\&. This is used to convert strings and filenames to the clients codepage for OS9 and Classic, i\&.e\&. for authentication and AFP messages (SIGUSR2 messaging)\&. This will also be the default for the volumes maccharset\&. Defaults to MAC_ROMAN\&.

\-advertise_ssh
.RS 4
Allows Mac OS X clients (10\&.3\&.3\-10\&.4) to automagically establish a tunneled AFP connection through SSH\&. If this option is set, the server\'s answers to client\'s FPGetSrvrInfo requests contain an additional entry\&. It depends on both client\'s settings and a correctly configured and running

Setting this option is not recommended since globally encrypting AFP connections via SSH will increase the server\'s load significantly\&. On the other hand, Apple\'s client side implementation of this feature in MacOS X versions prior to 10\&.3\&.4 contained a security flaw\&.

\-ddpaddr \fI[ddp address]\fR

.RE

\-fqdn \fI[name:port]\fR

Specifies a fully\-qualified domain name, with an optional port\&. This is discarded if the server cannot resolve it\&. This option is not honored by AppleShare clients <= 3\&.8\&.3\&.

The network address may be specified either in dotted\-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6\&. This option also allows to use one machine to advertise the AFP\-over\-TCP/IP settings of another machine via NBP

\-dsireadbuf \fI[number]\fR
.RS 4
Scale factor that determines the size of the DSI/TCP readahead buffer, default is 12\&. This is multiplies with the DSI server quantum (default ~300k) to give the size of the buffer\&. Increasing this value might increase throughput in fast local networks for volume to volume copies\&.

Technically they will be notified of the master afpd shutdown, sleep 15\-20 seconds and then try to reconnect their IPC channel to the master afpd process\&.

\-signature { user:<text> | auto }
.RS 4
Specify a server signature\&. This option is useful while running multiple independent instances of afpd on one machine (eg\&. in clustered environments, to provide fault isolation etc\&.)\&. Default is "auto"\&. "auto" signature type allows afpd generating signature and saving it to
:ETCDIR:/afp_signature\&.conf
automatically (based on random number)\&. "host" signature type switches back to "auto" because it is obsoleted\&. "user" signature type allows administrator to set up a signature string manually\&. The maximum length is 16 characters\&.

First two servers will appear as one logical AFP service to the clients \- if user logs in to first one and then connects to second one, session will be automatically redirected to the first one\&. But if client connects to first and then to third, will be asked for password twice and will see resources of both servers\&.
