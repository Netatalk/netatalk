.SH "NAME"
afp.conf \- Netatalk configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
afp\&.conf
file is the configuration file for the
\fBNetatalk\fR
AFP file server\&.
.PP
All AFP specific configuration and AFP volume definitions are done via this file\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        \fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR
      
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The file is line\-based \- that is, each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP
Section and parameter names are case sensitive\&.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim\&.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq) or a hash (\(lq#\(rq) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\(lq\e\(rq
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create masks are numeric\&.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [Global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\(lqvolume\(rq)\&. The section name is the name of the volume and the parameters within the section define the volume attributes and options\&.
.PP
There is one special sections, [Global], which is described under
\fIspecial sections\fR\&. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP
A volume consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service\&. For volumes the
\fBpath\fR
option must specify the directory to share\&.
.PP
Any section without
\fBpath\fR
option is considered a
\fIvol preset\fR
which can be selected in other volume sections via the
\fBvol preset\fR
option and constitutes defaults for the volume\&. For any option speficied both in a preset
\fIand\fR
in a volume section the volume section setting completly substitutes the preset option\&.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants\&.
.PP
The following sample section defines an AFP volume\&. The user has full access to the path
/foo/bar\&. The share is accessed via the share name
baz:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [baz]
        path = /foo/bar
      
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [Global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole\&. Parameters denoted by a (G) below are must be set in this section\&. Parameters denoted by a (V) belong to volume sections\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [Global] section (e\&.g\&.,
\fIlogtype\fR)\&. All others are permissible only in volume sections\&. The letter
\fIG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [Global] section\&. The letter
\fIV\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a volume specific section\&.
.PP
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order \- this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym\&.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
You can use variables in both volume path and volume name\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.SS "Codepage Options"
.PP
With OS X Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol\&. One of the big changes was, that AFP3 uses Unicode names encoded as Decomposed UTF\-8 (UTF8\-MAC)\&. Previous AFP/OS versions used codepages like MacRoman, MacCentralEurope, etc\&.
.PP
To be able to serve AFP3 and older clients at the same time,
\fBafpd\fR
needs to be able to convert between UTF\-8 and Mac codepages\&. Even OS X clients partly still rely on codepages\&. As there\'s no way,
\fBafpd\fR
can detect the codepage a pre AFP3 client uses, you have to specify it using the
\fBmaccodepage\fR
option\&. The default is MacRoman, which should be fine for most western users\&.
.PP
As
\fBafpd\fR
needs to interact with unix operating system as well, it need\'s to be able to convert from UTF8\-MAC/MacCodepage to the unix codepage\&. By default
\fBafpd\fR
uses the systems LOCALE, or ASCII if your system doesn\'t support locales\&. You can set the unix codepage using the
\fBunixcodepage\fR
option\&. If you\'re using extended characters in the configuration files for
\fBafpd\fR, make sure your terminal matches the
\fBunixcodepage\fR\&.
.PP
unixcodepage = \fICODEPAGE\fR \fB(G)\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the servers unix codepage, e\&.g\&. "ISO\-8859\-15" or "UTF8"\&. This is used to convert strings to/from the systems locale, e\&.g\&. for authenthication, server messages and volume names\&. Defaults to LOCALE if your system supports it, otherwise ASCII will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
maccodepage = \fICODEPAGE\fR \fB(G)\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the mac clients codepage, e\&.g\&. "MAC_ROMAN"\&. This is used to convert strings and filenames to the clients codepage for OS9 and Classic, i\&.e\&. for authentication and AFP messages (SIGUSR2 messaging)\&.

Specify a server signature\&. This option is useful while running multiple independent instances of afpd on one machine (eg\&. in clustered environments, to provide fault isolation etc\&.)\&. Default is "auto"\&. "auto" signature type allows afpd generating signature and saving it to

automatically (based on random number)\&. "host" signature type switches back to "auto" because it is obsoleted\&. "user" signature type allows administrator to set up a signature string manually\&. The maximum length is 16 characters\&.

Useful for TimeMachine: limits the reported volume size, thus preventing TM from using the whole real disk space for backup\&. Example: "volsizelimit:1000" would limit the reported disk space to 1 GB\&.

This is an approximated calculation taking into accout the contents of TM sparsebundle images\&. Therefor you MUST NOT use this volume to store other content when using this option, because it would NOT be accounted\&.

.SH "CHARSET OPTIONS"

With OS X Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol\&. One of the most important changes was that AFP3 uses unicode names encoded as UTF\-8 decomposed\&. Previous AFP/OS versions used codepages, like MacRoman, MacCentralEurope, etc\&.
.PP
\fBafpd\fR
needs a way to preserve extended macintosh characters, or characters illegal in unix filenames, when saving files on a unix filesystem\&. Earlier versions used the the so called CAP encoding\&. An extended character (>0x7F) would be converted to a :xx sequence, e\&.g\&. the Apple Logo (MacRoman: 0XF0) was saved as
:f0\&. Some special characters will be converted as to :xx notation as well\&. \'/\' will be encoded to
:2f, if
\fBusedots\fR
is not specified, a leading dot \'\&.\' will be encoded as
:2e\&.
.PP
This version now uses UTF\-8 as the default encoding for names\&. Special characters, like \'/\' and a leading \'\&.\' will still be CAP style encoded \&.
.PP
The
\fBvolcharset\fR
option will allow you to select another volume encoding\&. E\&.g\&. for western users another useful setting could be volcharset ISO\-8859\-15\&.
\fBapfd\fR
will accept any
\fBiconv\fR(1)
provided charset\&. If a character cannot be converted from the mac codepage to the selected volcharset, afpd will save it as a CAP encoded character\&. For AFP3 clients,
\fBafpd\fR
will convert the UTF\-8
character to
\fBmaccharset\fR
first\&. If this conversion fails, you\'ll receive a \-50 error on the mac\&.
