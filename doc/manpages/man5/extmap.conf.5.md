# Name

extmap.conf — Configuration file used by afpd to specify file name extension mappings

# Description

`extmap.conf` is the configuration file used by `afpd` to specify file
name extension mappings.

The configuration lines are composed like:

`.extension` <\[ type \[ creator \] \]\>

Any line beginning with a hash (“#”) character is ignored. The
leading-dot lines specify file name extension mappings. The extension
'.' sets the default creator and type for otherwise untyped Unix files.

# Examples

## Example: Extension is jpg, type is "JPEG", creator is "ogle"

    .jpg "JPEG" "ogle"

## Example: Extension is lzh, type is "LHA", creator is not defined

    .lzh "LHA"
