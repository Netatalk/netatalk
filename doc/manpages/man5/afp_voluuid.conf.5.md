# Name

afp_voluuid.conf â€” Configuration file used by afpd to specify UUID for AFP volumes

# Description

**afp_voluuid.conf** is the configuration file used by **afpd** to specify
UUID of all AFP volumes. The configuration lines are composed like:

<"volume-name"\> <uuid-string\>

The first field is volume name. Volume names must be quoted if they
contain spaces. The second field is the 36 character hexadecimal ASCII
string representation of a UUID.

The leading spaces and tabs are ignored. Blank lines are ignored. The
lines prefixed with \# are ignored. The illegal lines are ignored.

> **NOTE**

> This UUID is advertised by Zeroconf in order to provide robust
disambiguation of Time Machine volumes.

> It is also used by the MySQL CNID backend.

> This file should not be thoughtlessly edited and be copied onto another
server.
