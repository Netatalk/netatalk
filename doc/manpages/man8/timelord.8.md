# Name

timelord â€” Macintosh time server daemon

# Synopsis

`timelord [-d] [-l] [-n nbpname]`

`timelord [ -v | -V ]`

# Description

*timelord* is a simple time server for Macintosh computers that use the
*tardis* client. It has the same capabilities as the "Timelord" CDEV for
Macintosh.

*tardis* is implemented as a Chooser extension. In the Chooser, choose
the *timelord* instance to synchronize the Mac's system time with. Once
synchronized, *tardis* will automatically synchronize with the server at
boot, or scheduled at regular intervals while the Mac is running (the
latter requires tardis 1.4).

# Options

`-d`

> Debug mode, i.e. don't disassociate from controlling TTY.

`-l`

> Return the time zone adjusted localtime of the server. The default
behavior without this option is GMT.

`-n` <nbpname\>

> Register this server as *nbpname*. This defaults to the hostname.

-v | -V

> Print version information and exit.
