Information for Netatalk Developers
===================================

For basic installation instructions, see the html manual published on
https://netatalk.sourceforge.io

Netatalk is an implementation of "AFP over TCP".
DSI is a session layer used to carry AFP over TCP.
The complete stack looks like this:

          AFP
           |
          DSI
           |
           | (port:548)
           |
   -+---------------------------+- (kernel boundary)
    |         Socket            |
    +------------+--------------+
    |     TCP    |    UDP       |
    +------------+--------------+
    |       IP v4 or v6         |
    +---------------------------+
    |     Network-Interface     |

Compilation
===========
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.ac' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.


Tools for Developers
====================
1. Libtool
Libtool encapsulates the platform specific dependencies for the
creation of libraries. It determines if the local platform can support
shared libraries or if it only supports static libraries.

Documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/

2. GNU m4
GNU m4 is an implementation of the Unix macro processor. It reads
stdin and copies to stdout expanding defined macros as it processes
the text.

Documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

3. Autoconf
Autoconf is a package of m4 macros that produce shell scripts to
configure source code packages.

Documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

4. Automake
Automake is a tool that generates  'Makefile.in' files.

Documentation: http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

Required
========
5. Berkeley DB
Berkeley DB is a programmatic toolkit that provides fast, reliable,
scalable, and mission-critical database support to software
developers. BDB can downloaded from
https://github.com/berkeleydb/libdb

Netatalk's CNID database uses the library and header files from BDB.
Currently, Netatalk supports BDB 4.6 and later.


Optional
========
6. OpenSSL, LibreSSL and/or Libgcrypt
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library.
LibreSSL is a version of the TLS/crypto stack forked from OpenSSL.
This is required to enable DHX login support.

Get everything at http://www.openssl.org/ or http://www.libressl.org/

The Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library based on
the code from GnuPG.
This is required to enable DHX2 login support.

Get everything at https://gnupg.org/software/libgcrypt/

7. TCP Wrappers
Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or LOG_TCP. These
programs log the client host name of incoming telnet, ftp, rsh,
rlogin, finger etc. requests. Security options are: access control per
host, domain and/or service; detection of host name spoofing or host
address spoofing; booby traps to implement an early-warning system.
TCP Wrappers can be gotten at http://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/
Netatalk uses TCP Wrappers to authorize host access when using
afpovertcp. It should be noted that if DDP is in use, the connection
will still be allowed as TCP Wrappers do not impact DDP connections.

8. PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
PAM provides a flexible mechanism for authenticating
users. PAM was invented by SUN Microsystems.

Author: Andrew Morgan <morgan@linux.kernel.org>

Linux-PAM is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local system
administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
You can get the Linux PAM documentation and sources from
https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam

Netatalk also supports other standard PAM implementations such as OpenPAM.

Error checking and logging
==========================
We want rigid error checking and concise log messages. This often leads
to signifant code bloat where the relevant function call is buried in error
checking and logging statements.
In order to alleviate error checking and code readability, we provide a set
of error checking macros in <atalk/errchk.h>. These macros compare the return
value of statements againt 0, NULL, -1 (and maybe more, check it out).
Every macro comes in four flavours: EC_CHECK, EC_CHECK_LOG, EC_CHECK_LOG_ERR
and EC_CHECK_CUSTOM:
- EC_CHECK just checks the CHECK
- EC_CHECK_LOG additionally logs the stringified function call.
- EC_CHECK_LOG_ERR allows specifying the return value
- EC_CHECK_CUSTOM allows custom actions
The macros EC_CHECK* unconditionally jump to a cleanup label where the
neccessary cleanup can be done alongside controlling the return value.
EC_CHECK_CUSTOM doesn't do that, so an extra "goto EC_CLEANUP" may be
performed as appropiate.

Example:
- stat() without EC macro:
  static int func(const char *name) {
    int ret = 0;
    ...
    if ((ret = stat(name, &some_struct_stat)) != 0) {
      LOG(...);
      ret = -1; /* often needed to explicitly set the error indicating return value */
      goto cleanup;
    }

    return ret;

  cleanup:
    ...
    return ret;
  }

- stat() with EC macro:
  static int func(const char *name) {
    EC_INIT; /* expands to int ret = 0; */

    char *uppername = NULL
    EC_NULL(uppername = strdup(name));
    EC_ZERO(strtoupper(uppername));

    EC_ZERO(stat(uppername, &some_struct_stat)); /* expands to complete if block from above */

    EC_STATUS(0);

EC_CLEANUP:
    if (uppername) free(uppername);
    EC_EXIT;
  }

A boileplate function template is:

int func(void)
{
    EC_INIT;

    ...your code here...

    EC_STATUS(0);

EC_CLEANUP:
    EC_EXIT;
}

Ini Parser
==========

The ini parser is taken from <https://github.com/ndevilla/iniparser>.
It has been slightly modified:
- case-sensitive
- "include" directive added
- atalk_iniparser_getstrdup() to complemnt atalk_iniparser_getstring(), it returns allocated
  strings which the caller must free as necessary
- the API has been modifed such that all atalk_iniparser_get* funcs take a section and
  a parameter as seperare args instead of one string of the form "section:parameter"
  in the original library

CNID Database Daemons
=====================

The CNID database daemons cnid_metad and cnid_dbd are an implementation of
the netatalk CNID database support that attempts to put all functionality
into separate daemons.
There is one cnid_dbd daemon per netatalk volume. The underlying database
structure is based on Berkeley DB.

Advantages:

- No locking issues or leftover locks due to crashed afpd daemons any
  more. Since there is only one thread of control accessing the
  database, no locking is needed and changes appear atomic.

- Berkeley DB transactions are difficult to get right with several
  processes attempting to access the CNID database simultanously. This
  is much easier with a single process and the database can be made nearly
  crashproof this way (at a performance cost).

- No problems with user permissions and access to underlying database
  files, the cnid_dbd process runs under a configurable user
  ID that normally also owns the underlying database
  and can be contacted by whatever afpd daemon accesses a volume.

- If an afpd process crashes, the CNID database is unaffected. If the
  process was making changes to the database at the time of the crash,
  those changes will be rolled back entirely (transactions).
  If the process was not using the database at the time of the crash,
  no corrective action is necessary. In any case, database consistency
  is assured.

Disadvantages:

- Performance in an environment of processes sharing the database
  (files) is potentially better for two reasons:

  i)  IPC overhead.
  ii) r/o access to database pages is possible by more than one
      process at once, r/w access is possible for nonoverlapping regions.

  The current implementation of cnid_dbd uses unix domain sockets as
  the IPC mechanism. While this is not the fastest possible method, it
  is very portable and the cnid_dbd IPC mechanisms can be extended to
  use faster IPC (like mmap) on architectures where it is
  supported. As a ballpark figure, 20000 requests/replies to the cnid_dbd
  daemon take about 0.6 seconds on a Pentium III 733 Mhz running Linux
  Kernel 2.4.18 using unix domain sockets. The requests are "empty"
  (no database lookups/changes), so this is just the IPC
  overhead.

  I have not measured the effects of the advantages of simultanous
  database access.


Installation and configuration

There are two executeables that will be built in etc/cnid_dbd and
installed into the systems binaries directories of netatalk
cnid_metad and cnid_dbd. cnid_metad should run all the
time with root permissions. It will be notified when an instance of
afpd starts up and will in turn make sure that a cnid_dbd daemon is
started for the volume that afpd wishes to access. The cnid_dbd daemon runs as
long as necessary and services any
other instances of afpd that access the volume. You can safely kill it
with SIGTERM, it will be restarted automatically by cnid_metad as soon
as the volume is accessed again.

cnid_dbd changes to the Berkeley DB directory on startup and sets
effective UID and GID to owner and group of that directory. Database and
supporting files should therefore be writeable by that user/group.

Current shortcomings:

- The parameter file parsing of db_param is very simpleminded. It is
easy to cause buffer overruns and the like.
Also, there is no support for blanks (or weird characters) in
filenames for the usock_file parameter.

- There is no protection against a malicious user connecting to the
cnid_dbd socket and changing the database.

Documentation
=============
Netatalk documentation is in Docbook XML format. In order to build manpages
and the html documentation from the Docbook docs you need the following:

1. Install `xsltproc` and `docbook-xsl` via your operating system's package manager

2. If your operating system does not distribute docbook-xsl,
   get the latest Docbook XSL stylesheet distribution from:
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/
   The last tested docbook-xsl stylesheet version is 1.79.1.

3. Add the following argument to configure
   --with-docbook=ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_XML_STYLESHEET_DIR

4. The manpages and html documentation are now automatically built when running `make html`.

Editing Docbook Sources
-----------------------
Free WYSIWYG editor with only one minor drawback is XMLEditor from XMLmind:
http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/persoedition.html

Drawback: in order to be able to edit any of the  nested xml files, you have to
"promote" them to valid Docbook files by referencing the Docbook DTD, insert as line 2+3:
	
	<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN"
	"http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd">

These changes will however prevent XMLeditor from opening the master xml file
manual.xml. Before further processing can be done these changes then have to be
reverted for any changed file.
