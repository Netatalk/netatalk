        <secondary>Apple Filing Protocol</secondary>
      </indexterm> (the Apple Filing Protocol) is a protocol used on the Apple
    Macintosh for file services<indexterm>
        <primary>File Services</primary>

        <secondary>Netatalk's File Services</secondary>
      </indexterm>. The protocol has evolved over the years. The final
    revision of the protocol, AFP 3.4, was introduced with OS X Lion<indexterm>
        <primary>Lion</primary>

        <secondary>Mac OS X 10.7</secondary>
      </indexterm> (10.7).</para>

    <para>Netatalk's <command>afpd</command> daemon offers AFP fileservices to
    Apple clients. The configuration is managed through the
    <filename>afp.conf</filename> file which uses an ini style configuration
    syntax.</para>

    <para>Support for <link linkend="spotlight">Spotlight</link><indexterm>
        <primary>Spotlight</primary>
      </indexterm> was added in Netatalk 3.1.</para>

    <para>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) introduced support for Time Machine backups
    over AFP. Two new functions ensure that backups are written to disk, not
    just in the server's cache. Different host operating systems honor this
    cache flushing differently. To make a volume a Time Machine target, use
    the volume option "<option>time machine = yes</option>".</para>

    <para>Starting with Netatalk 2.1 UNIX symlinks<indexterm>
        <primary>symlink</primary>

        <secondary>UNIX symlink</secondary>
      </indexterm> can be used on the server. Semantics are the same as for
    e.g. NFS, i.e. they are not resolved on the server side but instead it's
    completely up to the client to resolve them, resulting in links that point
    somewhere inside the clients filesystem view.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>afp.conf</title>

      <para><filename>afp.conf</filename> is the configuration file used by
      afpd to determine the behaviour and configuration of the AFP file server
      and the AFP volume that it provides.</para>

      <para>The <filename>afp.conf</filename> is divided into several
      sections:<variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>[Global]</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The global section defines general server options</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>[Homes]</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The homes section defines user home volumes</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>Any section not called <option>Global</option> or
      <option>Homes</option> is interpreted as an AFP volume.</para>

      <para>For sharing user homes by defining a <option>Homes</option>
      section you must specify the option <option>basedir regex</option> which
      can be a simple string with the path to the parent directory of all user
      homes or a regular expression.</para>

      <para>Example:</para>

      <para><programlisting>[Homes]
basedir regex = /home
</programlisting></para>

      <para>Now any user logging into the AFP server will have a user volume
      available whose path is <filename>/home/NAME</filename>.</para>

      <para>A more complex setup would be a server with a large amount of user
      homes which are split across e.g. two different
      filesystems:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>/RAID1/homes</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>/RAID2/morehomes</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>The following configuration is
      required:<programlisting>[Homes]
basedir regex = /RAID./.*homes
</programlisting></para>

      <para>If <option>basedir regex</option> contains a symlink, set the
      canonicalized absolute path. When <filename>/home</filename> links to
      <filename>/usr/home</filename>: <programlisting>[Homes]
basedir regex = /usr/home</programlisting></para>

      </indexterm></title>

    <para>Unlike other protocols like SMB or NFS, the AFP protocol mostly
    refers to files and directories by ID and not by a path (the IDs are also
    called CNID, which stand for Catalog Node ID). A typical AFP request uses
    a directory ID<indexterm>
        <primary>DID</primary>

        <secondary>Directory ID</secondary>
      </indexterm> and a filename, something like <phrase>"server, please open
    the file named 'Test' in the directory with id 167"</phrase>. For example
    "Aliases" on the Mac basically work by ID (with a fallback to the absolute
    path in more recent AFP clients. But this applies only to Finder, not to
    applications).</para>

    <para>Every file in an AFP volume has to have a unique file ID<indexterm>
        <primary>FID</primary>

        <secondary>File ID</secondary>
      </indexterm>, IDs must, according to the specs, never be reused, and IDs
    are 32 bit numbers (Directory IDs use the same ID pool). So, after ~4
    billion files/folders have been written to an AFP volume, the ID pool is
    depleted and no new file can be written to the volume. No whining please
    :-)</para>

    <para>Netatalk needs to map IDs to files and folders in the host
    filesystem. To achieve this, several different CNID backends<indexterm>
        <primary>CNID backend</primary>
      </indexterm> are available and can be selected with the <option>cnid
    scheme</option><indexterm>

        <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry> configuration file. A CNID backend is basically a
    database storing ID &lt;-&gt; name mappings.</para>

    <para>The CNID databases are by default located in
    <filename>$prefix/var/netatalk/CNID</filename>. You can change the location by
    configuring <command>-Dwith-statedir-path=PATH</command> at compile time.</para>

    <para>There is a command line utility called <command>dbd</command>
    available which can be used to verify, repair and rebuild the CNID
    database.</para>

    <note>
      <para>There are some CNID related things you should keep in mind when
      working with netatalk:</para>

          <para>If there's no more space on the filesystem left, the database

          database corruption. Use the <option>vol dbpath</option> directive

      <para>The "Database Daemon" backend is built on Berkeley DB. Access to
      the CNID database is restricted to the cnid_dbd daemon process. afpd
      processes communicate with the daemon for database reads and updates.
      The probability for database corruption is practically zero.</para>

      <title>Why Unicode?</title>

      <para>Internally, computers don't know anything about characters and
      texts, they only know numbers. Therefore, each letter is assigned a
      number. A character set, often referred to as
      <emphasis>charset</emphasis> or <emphasis>codepage</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>Codepage</primary>
        </indexterm>, defines the mappings between numbers and letters.</para>

      <para>If two or more computer systems need to communicate with each
      other, the have to use the same character set. In the 1960s the
      ASCII<indexterm>
          <primary>ASCII</primary>

          <secondary>American Standard Code for Information
          Interchange</secondary>
        </indexterm> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
      character set was defined by the American Standards Association. The
      original form of ASCII represented 128 characters, more than enough to
      cover the English alphabet and numerals. Up to date, ASCII has been the
      normative character scheme used by computers.</para>

      <para>Later versions defined 256 characters to produce a more
      international fluency and to include some slightly esoteric graphical
      characters. Using this mode of encoding each character takes exactly one
      byte. Obviously, 256 characters still wasn't enough to map all the
      characters used in the various languages into one character set.</para>

      <para>As a result localized character sets were defined later, e.g the
      ISO-8859 character sets. Most operating system vendors introduced their
      own characters sets to satisfy their needs, e.g. IBM defined the
      <emphasis>codepage 437 (DOSLatinUS)</emphasis>, Apple introduced the
      <emphasis>MacRoman</emphasis><indexterm>
          <primary>MacRoman</primary>

          <secondary>MacRoman charset</secondary>
        </indexterm> codepage and so on. The characters that were assigned
      number larger than 127 were referred to as <emphasis>extended</emphasis>
      characters. These character sets conflict with another, as they use the
      same number for different characters, or vice versa.</para>

      <para>Almost all of those characters sets defined 256 characters, where
      the first 128 (0-127) character mappings are identical to ASCII. As a
      result, communication between systems using different codepages was
      effectively limited to the ASCII charset.</para>

      <para>To solve this problem new, larger character sets were defined. To
      make room for more character mappings, these character sets use at least
      2 bytes to store a character. They are therefore referred to as
      <emphasis>multibyte</emphasis> character sets.</para>

      <para>One standardized multibyte charset encoding scheme is known as
      <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org/">unicode</ulink>. A big advantage of
      using a multibyte charset is that you only need one. There is no need to
      make sure two computers use the same charset when they are
      communicating.</para>

      <title>Character sets used by Apple</title>

      <para>In the past, Apple clients used single-byte charsets to
      communicate over the network. Over the years Apple defined a number of
      codepages, western users will most likely be using the
      <emphasis>MacRoman</emphasis> codepage.</para>

      <para>Starting with Mac OS X and AFP3, <ulink
      url="http://www.utf-8.com/">UTF-8</ulink> is used. UTF-8 encodes Unicode
      characters in an ASCII compatible way, each Unicode character is encoded
      into 1-6 ASCII characters. UTF-8 is therefore not really a charset
      itself, it's an encoding of the Unicode charset.</para>

      <para>To complicate things, Unicode defines several <emphasis> <ulink

      </emphasis> forms. While <ulink

      <para>For example lets take the German character '<keycode>ä</keycode>'.
      Using the precomposed normalization, Unicode maps this character to
      0xE4. In decomposed normalization, 'ä' is actually mapped to two
      characters, 0x61 and 0x308. 0x61 is the mapping for an 'a', 0x308 is the

          real single sign on scenarios using Kerberos tickets. The password
          is not sent over the network. Instead, the user password is used to
          decrypt a service ticket for the AppleShare server. The service
          ticket contains an encryption key for the client and some encrypted
          data (which only the AppleShare server can decrypt). The encrypted
          portion of the service ticket is sent to the server and used to
          authenticate the user. Because of the way that the afpd service
          principal detection is implemented, this authentication method is
          vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Using different authentication sources with specific UAMs</title>

      <para>Some UAMs provide the ability to use different authentication
      "backends", namely <filename>uams_cleartext.so</filename>,
      <filename>uams_dhx.so</filename> and <filename>uams_dhx2.so</filename>.
      They can use either classic UNIX passwords from
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> (<filename>/etc/shadow</filename>) or
      PAM if the system supports that. <filename>uams_cleartext.so</filename>
      can be symlinked to either <filename>uams_passwd.so</filename> or
      <filename>uams_pam.so</filename>, <filename>uams_dhx.so</filename> to
      <filename>uams_dhx_passwd.so</filename> or
      <filename>uams_dhx_pam.so</filename> and
      <filename>uams_dhx2.so</filename> to
      <filename>uams_dhx2_passwd.so</filename> or
      <filename>uams_dhx2_pam.so</filename>.</para>

      <para>So, if it looks like this in Netatalk's UAMs folder (per default
      <filename>/etc/netatalk/uams/</filename>):<programlisting>uams_clrtxt.so -&gt; uams_pam.so
uams_dhx.so -&gt; uams_dhx_pam.so
uams_dhx2.so -&gt; uams_dhx2_pam.so</programlisting> then you're using PAM,
      otherwise classic UNIX passwords. The main advantage of using PAM is
      that one can integrate Netatalk in centralized authentication scenarios,
      e.g. via LDAP, NIS and the like. Please always keep in mind that the
      protection of your user's login credentials in such scenarios also
      depends on the strength of encryption that the UAM in question supplies.
      So think about eliminating weak UAMs like "ClearTxt Passwrd" and
      "Randnum exchange" completely from your network.</para>

        attempts will be sent encrypted over the wire since the local AFP
        client will connect to the Mac's local port 10548 which will be
        forwarded to the remote server's AFP port (we used the default 548)
        over SSH.</para>

        <para>This sort of tunnel is an ideal solution if you must access an
        AFP server through the Internet without having the ability or desire
        to use a "real" VPN. Note that you can let <command>ssh</command>
        compress the data by using its "-C" switch and that the tunnel
        endpoints can be different from both AFP client and server (compare
        with the SSH documentation for details).</para>

        <title>Automatically establishing a tunneled AFP connection</title>

        <para>From Mac OS X 10.2 to 10.4, Apple added an "Allow Secure
        Connections Using SSH" checkbox to the "Connect to Server" dialog. The
        idea behind this was: When the server signals that it can be contacted
        by SSH then macOS's AFP client tries to establish the tunnel and
        automagically send all AFP traffic through it.</para>

        <para>But it took until the release of Mac OS X 10.3 that this feature
        worked the first time... partly. In case, the SSH tunnel could not be
        established and the AFP client <emphasis
        role="strong">silently</emphasis> fell back to an unencrypted AFP
        connection attempt.</para>

        <para>Netatalk's afpd will report that it is capable of handling SSH
        tunneled AFP requests, when both "<option>advertise ssh</option>" and

            <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
          </citerefentry> after you restarted afpd when you made changes to
        the settings). But there are a couple of reasons why you don't want to
        use this option at all:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Most users who need such a feature are probably already
            familiar with using a VPN; it might be easier for the user to
            employ the same VPN software in order to connect to the network on
            which the AFP server is running, and then to access the AFP server
            as normal.</para>

            <para>That being said, for the simple case of connecting to one
            specific AFP server, a direct SSH connection is likely to perform
            better than a general-purpose VPN; contrary to popular belief,
            tunneling via SSH does <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis>
            result in what's called "TCP-over-TCP meltdown", because the AFP
            data that are being tunneled do not encapsulate TCP data.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Since this SSH kludge isn't a normal UAM that integrates
            directly into the AFP authentication mechanisms but instead uses a
            single flag signalling clients whether they can <emphasis
            role="strong">try</emphasis> to establish a tunnel or not, it
            makes life harder to see what's happening when things go
            wrong.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>You cannot control which machines are logged on by Netatalk
            tools like a <command>macusers</command> since all connection
            attempts seem to be made from localhost.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Indeed, to ensure that all AFP sessions are encrypted via
            SSH, you need to limit afpd to connections that originate only
            from localhost (e.g., by using Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers, or by
            using suitable firewall or packet-filtering facilities,
            etc.).</para>

            <para>Otherwise, when you're using Mac OS X 10.2 through 10.3.3,
            you get the opposite of what you'd expect: potentially unencrypted
            AFP communications (including login credentials) being sent across
            the network without a single notification that establishing the
            tunnel failed. Apple fixed that with Mac OS X 10.3.4.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Encrypting all AFP sessions via SSH can lead to a
            significantly higher load on the computer that is running the AFP
            server, because that computer must also handle encryption; if the
            user is connecting through a trusted network, then such encryption
            might be an unnecessary overhead.</para>

      <title>Configuration</title>

      <para>For a basic mode of operation there's nothing to configure.
      Netatalk reads ACLs on the fly and calculates effective permissions
      which are then send to the AFP client via the so called
      UARights<indexterm>
          <primary>UARights</primary>
        </indexterm> permission bits. On a Mac, the Finder uses these bits to
      adjust permission in Finder windows. Example: a folder whose UNIX mode
      is read-only and an ACL giving the user write access, will display the
      effective read-write permission. Without the permission mapping the
      Finder would display a read-only icon and the user wouldn't be able to
      write to the folder.</para>

      <para>By default, the effective permission of the authenticated user are
      only mapped to the mentioned UARights<indexterm>
          <primary>UARights</primary>
        </indexterm>permission structure, not the UNIX mode. You can adjust
      this behaviour with the configuration option <link
      linkend="map_acls">map acls</link>.</para>

      <para>However, neither in Finder "Get Info" windows nor in the Terminal
      will you be able to see the ACLs, because of how ACLs in macOS are
      designed. If you want to be able to display ACLs on the client, things
      get more involved as you must then setup both client and server to be
      part on a authentication domain (directory service, e.g. LDAP,
      OpenDirectory). The reason is, that in macOS ACLs are bound to UUIDs,
      not just uid's or gid's. Therefore afpd must be able to map every
      filesystem uid and gid to a UUID so that it can return the server side
      ACLs which are bound to UNIX uid and gid mapped to macOS UUIDs.</para>

      <para>Netatalk can query a directory server using LDAP queries. Either
      the directory server already provides an UUID attribute for user and
      groups (Active Directory, Open Directory) or you reuse an unused
      attribute (or add a new one) to you directory server (eg
      OpenLDAP).</para>

      <title>macOS ACLs</title>

      <para>With Access Control Lists (ACLs), macOS offers a powerful
      extension of the traditional UNIX permissions model. An ACL is an
      ordered list of Access Control Entries (ACEs) explicitly granting or
      denying a set of permissions to a given user or group.</para>

      <para>Unlike UNIX permissions, which are bound to user or group IDs,
      ACLs are tied to UUIDs. For this reason accessing an object's ACL
      requires server and client to use a common directory service which
      translates between UUIDs and user/group IDs.</para>

      <para>ACLs and UNIX permissions interact in a rather simple way. As ACLs
      are optional UNIX permissions act as a default mechanism for access
      control. Changing an objects's UNIX permissions will leave it's ACL
      intact and modifying an ACL will never change the object's UNIX
      permissions. While doing access checks, macOS first examines an object's
      ACL evaluating ACEs in order until all requested rights have been
      granted, a requested right has been explicitly denied by an ACE or the
      end of the list has been reached. In case there is no ACL or the
      permissions granted by the ACL are not sufficient to fulfill the
      request, macOS next evaluates the object's UNIX permissions. Therefore
      ACLs always have precedence over UNIX permissions.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>Compared to macOS or NFSv4 ACLs, POSIX ACLs represent a
        different, less versatile approach to overcome the limitations of the
        traditional UNIX permissions. Implementations are based on the
        withdrawn POSIX 1003.1e standard.</para>

        <para>The standard defines two types of ACLs. Files and directories
        can have access ACLs which are consulted for access checks.
        Directories can also have default ACLs irrelevant to access checks.
        When a new object is created inside a directory with a default ACL,
        the default ACL is applied to the new object as it's access ACL.
        Subdirectories inherit default ACLs from their parent. There are no
        further mechanisms of inheritance control.</para>

        <para>Architectural differences between POSIX ACLs and macOS ACLs

              <para>No fine-granular permissions model. Like UNIX permissions

        <para>POSIX 1003.1e defines 6 different types of ACL entries. The
        first three types are used to integrate standard UNIX permissions.
        They form a minimal ACL, their presence is mandatory and only one
        entry of each type is allowed within an ACL.</para>

              granted by entries of type ACL_GROUP_OBJ, ACL_USER and
              ACL_GROUP. As the name suggests, this entry acts as a mask. Only
              one ACL_MASK entry is allowed per ACL. If an ACL contains
              ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP entries, an ACL_MASK entry must be present
              too, otherwise it is optional.</para>

          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>In order to maintain compatibility with applications not aware
        of ACLs, POSIX 1003.1e changes the semantics of system calls and
        utilities which retrieve or manipulate an object's UNIX permissions.
        In case an object only has a minimal ACL, the group permissions bits
        of the UNIX permissions correspond to the value of the ACL_GROUP_OBJ
        entry.</para>

        <para>However, if the ACL also contains an ACL_MASK entry, the
        behavior of those system calls and utilities is different. The group
        permissions bits of the UNIX permissions correspond to the value of
        the ACL_MASK entry, i. e. calling "chmod g-w" will not only revoke
        write access for the group, but for all entities which have been
        granted write access by ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP entries.</para>

        <title>Mapping POSIX ACLs to macOS ACLs</title>

        <para>When a client wants to read an object's ACL, afpd maps it's
        POSIX ACL onto an equivalent macOS ACL. Writing an object's ACL
        requires afpd to map an macOS ACL onto a POSIX ACL. Due to
        architectural restrictions of POSIX ACLs, it is usually impossible to
        find an exact mapping so that the result of the mapping process will
        be an approximation of the original ACL's semantic.</para>

        handles *unix permissions and ACLs the same way as Apple's reference
        implementation of AFP does. When an object's UNIX permissions are
        requested, afpd calculates proper group rights and returns the result
        together with the owner's and everybody's access rights to the caller
        via "permissions" and "ua_permissions" members of the FPUnixPrivs
        structure (see Apple Filing Protocol Reference, page 181). Changing an
        object's permissions, afpd always updates ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ
        and ACL_OTHERS. If an ACL_MASK entry is present too, afpd recalculates
        it's value so that the new group rights become effective and existing
        entries of type ACL_USER or ACL_GROUP stay intact.</para>

            <para>Large filesystems</para>

            <para>Tracker on Linux uses the inotify Kernel filesystem change
            event API for tracking filesystem changes. On large filesystems
            this may be problematic since the inotify API doesn't offer
            recursive directory watches but instead requires that for every
            subdirectoy watches must be added individually.</para>

            <para>On Solaris the FEN file event notification system is used.
            It is unknown which limitations and resource consumption this
            Solaris subsystem may have.</para>

            <para>We therefore recommend to disable live filesystem monitoring
            and let Tracker periodically scan filesystems for changes instead,
            see the Tracker configuration options <link
            linkend="enable-monitors">enable-monitors</link> and <link

            <para>A known limitation with the current implementation means
            that shared volumes in a user's home directory does not get
            indexed by Spotlight.</para>

            <para>As a workaround, keep the shared volumes you want to have
            indexed elsewhere on the host filesystem.</para>

      <para>If the .tracker_profile file does not exist, create it first. If
      you need to make the environment variables persistent, source
      .tracker_profile from /root/.profile. If needed, adjust PREFIX to point

      the localstate directory configured at compile time. <screen>$ su

        <para>Tracker stores its configuration via Gnome dconf backend which
        can be modified with the command <command>gsettings</command>.</para>

        <para>Gnome dconf settings are per-user settings, so, as Netatalk runs
        the Tracker processes as root, the settings are stored in the root
        user context and reading or changing these settings must be performed
        as root and Netatalk must be running (and again the environment must
        be set up as shown above).</para>

              disable it and instead rely on periodic crawling of Tracker
