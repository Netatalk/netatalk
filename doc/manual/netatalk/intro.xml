  <title>Introduction to Netatalk</title>

  <para>Netatalk is an OpenSource software package, that can be used to turn
  a *NIX machine into an extremely high-performance and
  reliable file server for Macintosh computers.</para>

  <para>Using Netatalk's AFP 3.3 compliant file-server leads to significantly
  higher transmission speeds compared with Macs accessing a server via
  SaMBa/NFS while providing clients with the best possible user experience
  (full support for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed
  environments of classic MacOS and MacOS X clients)</para>

  <para>Due to Netatalk speaking AppleTalk, the print-server task can provide
  printing clients with full AppleTalk support as well as the server itself
  with printing capabilities for AppleTalk-only printers. Starting with
  version 2.0, Netatalk seamlessly interacts with CUPS on the server.</para>

  <para>After all, Netatalk can be used to act as an AppleTalk router,
  providing both segmentation and zone names in Macintosh networks.</para>
