      </indexterm> services and both can run at the same time. Classic AFP

      <title>Setting up the AFP file server</title>

      <para>AFP (the Apple Filing Protocol) is the protocol Apple Macintoshes
      use for file services. The protocol has evolved over the years. The
      latest changes to the protocol, called "AFP 3.3", were added with the
      release of Snow Leopard<indexterm>
          <primary>Snow Leopard</primary>

          <secondary>Mac OS X 10.6</secondary>
        </indexterm> (Mac OS X 10.6).</para>

      <para>AFP3 brought some big changes. For the first time, AFP3 supports
      pathnames up to 65535 characters. It is virtually unlimited. Netatalk
      2.x supports filenames up to 255 characters because Mac OS X 10.4 and
      earlier can use it up to 255 characters (actually 255 bytes leading to
      85-255 chars depending on the glyphs used), Decomposed UTF-8 (UTF8-MAC)
      is used on the wire and large files (&gt;4GB) are supported.</para>

      <para>The afpd daemon offers the fileservices to Apple Clients. It's
      configured using the <filename>afpd.conf</filename> and the
      <filename>AppleVolumes.*</filename> files.</para>

      <para>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) added support for Time Machine backups
      over AFP. Two new functions ensure that backups are written to spinning
      disk, not just in the server's cache. Different host operating systems
      honour this cache flushing differently. To make a volume a Time Machine
      target use the <citerefentry>

          <primary>symlink</primary>

          <secondary>UNIX symlink</secondary>
        </indexterm> can be used on the server. Semantics are the same as for
      eg NFS, ie they are not resolved on the server side but instead it's
      completely up to the client to resolve them, resulting in links that
      point somewhere inside the clients filesystem view.</para>

        <title>afpd.conf</title>

        <para>afpd.conf is the configuration file used by afpd to determine
        the behaviour and configuration of the different virtual file servers
        that it provides. Any line not prefixed with <keycode>'#</keycode>' is
        interpreted.</para>

        <para>If afpd switches set on the command line are in conflict with
        afpd.conf settings, the latter will have higher priority.</para>

        <para>Format: - [options] to specify options for the default server
        and/or "Server name" [options] to specify an additional server.</para>

        <para>Leaving the afpd.conf file empty equals to the following

        guest. A volume will not be presented in the chooser, if the user has
        no read access to the specified volume path.</para>

      <para>Unlike other protocols like smb or nfs, the AFP protocol mostly
      refers to files and directories by ID and not by a path (the IDs are
      also called CNID, that means Catalog Node ID). A typical AFP request
      uses a directory ID<indexterm>
          <primary>DID</primary>

          <secondary>Directory ID</secondary>
        </indexterm> and a filename, something like <phrase>"server, please
      open the file named 'Test' in the directory with id 167"</phrase>. For
      example "Aliases" on the Mac basically work by ID (with a fallback to
      the absolute path in more recent AFP clients. But this applies only to
      Finder, not to applications).</para>

      <para>Every file in an AFP volume has to have a unique file ID<indexterm>
          <primary>FID</primary>

          <secondary>File ID</secondary>
        </indexterm>, IDs must, according to the specs, never be reused, and
      IDs are 32 bit numbers (Directory IDs use the same ID pool). So, after
      ~4 billion files/folders have been written to an AFP volume, the ID pool
      is depleted and no new file can be written to the volume. No whining
      please :-)</para>

      <para>Netatalk needs to map IDs to files and folders in the host
      filesystem. To achieve this, several different CNID backends<indexterm>
          <primary>CNID backend</primary>
        </indexterm> are available and can be choosed by the

          <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
        </citerefentry> configuration file. A CNID backend is basically a
      database storing ID &lt;-&gt; name mappings.</para>

      <para>The CNID Databases are by default located in the

          <primary>ADv2</primary>

          <secondary>AppleDouble v2</secondary>
        </indexterm> format, afpd stores the files/directories ID in the
      corresponding .AppleDouble file as well.</para>

      <para>Starting with Netatalk 2.1 there is a command line utility called
      <command>dbd</command> available which can be used to verify, repair and
      rebuild the CNID database.</para>

      <note>
        <para>There are some CNID related things you should keep in mind when
        working with netatalk:</para>

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>CNID backends are databases, so they turn afpd into a file
            server/database mix. Keep this in mind, killing an afpd process
            with <command>kill -9</command> will likely leave the database
            unusable.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>If there's no more space on the filesystem left, the
            database will get corrupted. You can work around this by either
            using the -dbpath option and put the database files into another
            location or, if you use quotas, make sure the .AppleDB folder is
            owned by a user/group without a quota<indexterm>

            <para>Be careful with CNID databases for volumes that are mounted
            via NFS. That is a pretty audacious decision to make anyway, but
            putting a database there as well is really asking for trouble,
            i.e. database corruption. Use the dbpath: directive in the
            <filename>AppleVolumes.*</filename> configuration files to put the
            databases onto a local disk if you must use NFS<indexterm>

        Netatalk 2.1 ie Netatalk 2.1.1, will support BerkeleyDB updates on the

        contain code to prepare the BerkeleyDB database for upgrades and to
        upgrade it in case it has been prepared before. That means it can't
        upgrade a 2.0.x version because that one didn't prepare the

          </indexterm></title>

        <para>The "concurrent database" backend is based on sleepycat's
        Berkeley DB. With this backend, several afpd daemons access the CNID
        database directly. Berkeley DB locking is used to synchronize access,
        if more than one afpd process is active for a volume. The drawback is,
        that the crash of a single afpd process might corrupt the database.
        cdb should only be used when sharing home directories for a larger
        number of users <emphasis>and</emphasis> it has been determined that a
        large number of <command>cnid_dbd</command> processes is

          </indexterm></title>

        <para>Access to the CNID database is restricted to the cnid_dbd daemon
        process. afpd processes communicate with the daemon for database reads
        and updates. The probability for database corruption is practically
        zero. As a database process gets spawned for each volume, you're
        probably better off using cdb for sharing home directories for a
        larger number of users.</para>

          </important>This backend is also used internally (as in-memory CNID
        database) as a fallback in case opening the primary database can't be

        <title>Why Unicode?</title>

        <para>Internally, computers don't know anything about characters and
        texts, they only know numbers. Therefore, each letter is assigned a
        number. A character set, often referred to as
        <emphasis>charset</emphasis> or
        <emphasis>codepage</emphasis><indexterm>
            <primary>Codepage</primary>
          </indexterm>, defines the mappings between numbers and
        letters.</para>

        <para>If two or more computer systems need to communicate with each
        other, the have to use the same character set. In the 1960s the
        ASCII<indexterm>
            <primary>ASCII</primary>

            <secondary>American Standard Code for Information
            Interchange</secondary>
          </indexterm> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
        character set was defined by the American Standards Association. The
        original form of ASCII represented 128 characters, more than enough to
        cover the English alphabet and numerals. Up to date, ASCII has been
        the normative character scheme used by computers.</para>

        <para>Later versions defined 256 characters to produce a more
        international fluency and to include some slightly esoteric graphical
        characters. Using this mode of encoding each character takes exactly
        one byte. Obviously, 256 characters still wasn't enough to map all the
        characters used in the various languages into one character
        set.</para>

        <para>As a result localized character sets were defined later, e.g the
        ISO-8859 character sets. Most operating system vendors introduced
        their own characters sets to satisfy their needs, e.g. IBM defined the
        <emphasis>codepage 437 (DOSLatinUS)</emphasis>, Apple introduced the
        <emphasis>MacRoman</emphasis><indexterm>
            <primary>MacRoman</primary>

            <secondary>MacRoman charset</secondary>
          </indexterm> codepage and so on. The characters that were assigned
        number larger than 127 were referred to as
        <emphasis>extended</emphasis> characters. These character sets
        conflict with another, as they use the same number for different
        characters, or vice versa.</para>

        <para>Almost all of those characters sets defined 256 characters,
        where the first 128 (0-127) character mappings are identical to ASCII.
        As a result, communication between systems using different codepages
        was effectively limited to the ASCII charset.</para>

        <para>To solve this problem new, larger character sets were defined.
        To make room for more character mappings, these character sets use at
        least 2 bytes to store a character. They are therefore referred to as
        <emphasis>multibyte</emphasis> character sets.</para>

        <para>One standardized multibyte charset encoding scheme is known as
        <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org/">unicode</ulink>. A big advantage
        of using a multibyte charset is that you only need one. There is no
        need to make sure two computers use the same charset when they are
        communicating.</para>

        <title>character sets used by Apple</title>

        <para>In the past, Apple clients used single-byte charsets to
        communicate over the network. Over the years Apple defined a number of
        codepages, western users will most likely be using the
        <emphasis>MacRoman</emphasis> codepage.</para>

        <para>Starting with Mac OS X and AFP3, <ulink

        <para>For example lets take the German character

        <para>So, if it looks like this in Netatalk's UAMs folder (per default
        <filename>/etc/netatalk/uams/</filename>):<programlisting>uams_clrtxt.so -&gt; uams_pam.so
uams_dhx.so -&gt; uams_dhx_pam.so
uams_dhx2.so -&gt; uams_dhx2_pam.so</programlisting> then you're using PAM,
        otherwise classic Unix passwords. The main advantage of using PAM is
        that one can integrate Netatalk in centralized authentication
        scenarios, eg. via LDAP, NIS and the like. Please always keep in mind
        that the protection of your user's login credentials in such scenarios
        also depends on the strength of encryption that the UAM in question
        supplies. So think about eliminating weak UAMs like "ClearTxt Passwrd"
        and "Randnum exchange" completely from your network.</para>

        <title>SSH tunneling</title>

        <para>Tunneling and all sort of VPN stuff has nothing to do with AFP
        authentication and UAMs in general. But since Apple introduced an
        option called "Allow Secure Connections Using SSH" and many people
        tend to confuse both things, we'll speak about that here too.</para>

        <sect4 id="manualsshtunnel">
          <title>Manually tunneling an AFP session</title>

          <para>This works since the first AFP servers that spoke "AFP over
          TCP" appeared in networks. One simply tunnels the remote server's
          AFP port to a local port different than 548 and connects locally to
          this port afterwards. On MacOS X this can be done by</para>

          <programlisting>ssh -l $USER $SERVER -L 10548:127.0.0.1:548 sleep 3000</programlisting>

          <para>After establishing the tunnel one will use
          <filename>"afp://127.0.0.1:10548"</filename> in the "Connect to
          server" dialog. All AFP traffic including the initial connection
          attempts will be sent encrypted over the wire since the local AFP
          client will connect to the Mac's local port 10548 which will be
          forwarded to the remote server's AFP port (we used the default 548)
          over SSH.</para>

          <para>These sorts of tunnels are an ideal solution if you've to
          access an AFP server providing weak authentications mechanisms
          through the Internet without having the ability to use a "real" VPN.
          Note that you can let <command>ssh</command> compress the data by
          using its "-C" switch and that the tunnel endpoints can be different
          from both AFP client and server (compare with the SSH documentation
          for details).</para>
        </sect4>

        <sect4 id="autosshtunnel">
          <title>Automatically establishing a tunneled AFP connection</title>

          <para>From Mac OS X 10.2 to 10.4, Apple added an "Allow Secure
          Connections Using SSH" checkbox to the "Connect to Server" dialog.
          The idea behind: When the server signals that it can be contacted by
          SSH then Mac OS X' AFP client tries to establish the tunnel and
          automagically sends all AFP traffic through it.</para>

          <para>But it took until the release of Mac OS X 10.3 that this
          feature worked the first time... partly. In case, the SSH tunnel
          can't be established the AFP client <emphasis
          role="strong">silently</emphasis> fell back to an unencrypted AFP
          connection attempt.</para>

          <para>Netatalk's afpd will report that it is capable of handling SSH
          tunneled AFP requests, when both <filename>-advertise_ssh</filename>

        that in OS X ACLs are bound to UUIDs, not just uid's or gid's.

      <title>To use AppleTalk or not</title>

          <refentrytitle>papd</refentrytitle>

          <manvolnum>8</manvolnum>
        </citerefentry> for older Mac clients.</para>

      <para>But even if you don't need PAP or AFP over AppleTalk, you might
      consider using AppleTalk for service propagation/location, having the
      ease of use for your network clients in mind. The Apple engineers
      implemented a way to easily locate an AFP server via AppleTalk but
      establishing the AFP connection itself via AFP over TCP (see the

      <para>To use AppleTalk/atalkd, your system has to have kernel support
      for AppleTalk. On some systems supported by netatalk, this isn't
      currently true (notably True64 Unix) so you can use only netatalk
      services that do not rely on AppleTalk (which means "AFP over TCP" and

      <para>This is the most simple form, you can use AppleTalk with netatalk.
      In case, you have only one network interface up and running, you haven't
      to deal with atalkd's config at all: atalkd will use AppleTalk's
      self-configuration features to get an AppleTalk address and to register
      itself in the network automagically.</para>

      <para>In case, you have more than one active network interface, you have
      to make a decision:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Using only one interface: Just add the interface name (en1,
          le0, eth2, ... for example) to atalkd.conf on a single line. Do only
          list <emphasis>one</emphasis> interface here.</para>

          <example>
            <title>atalkd.conf containing one entry</title>

            <para><programlisting>eth0</programlisting>AppleTalk networking
            should be enabled on eth0 interface. All the necessary
            configuration will be fetched from the network</para>
          </example>

          <para>At startup time, atalkd will add the real settings (address
          and network and eventually a zone) to atalkd.conf on its own</para>

          <example>
            <title>atalkd.conf containing one entry after atalkd
            started</title>

            <para><programlisting>eth0 -phase 2 -net 0-65534 -addr 65280.166</programlisting>
            atalkd filled in the AppleTalk settings that apply to this network
            segment. A netrange of 0-65534 indicates that there is no
            AppleTalk router present, so atalkd will fetch an address that
            matches the following criteria: netrange from inside the so called
            "startup range" 65280-65533 and a node address between 142 and
            255.</para>
          </example>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>When using several interfaces you have to add them line by
          line following the "-dontroute" switch in atalkd.conf.</para>

          <example>
            <title>atalkd.conf containing several entries with the -dontroute
            option</title>

            <para><programlisting>eth0 -dontroute eth1 -dontroute eth2 -dontroute</programlisting>Appletalk
            networking should be enabled on all three interfaces, but no
            routing should be done between the different segments. Again, all
            the necessary configuration will be fetched from the connected
            networks.</para>
          </example>

          <example>
            <title>atalkd.conf containing several entries with the -dontroute
            option after atalkd started</title>

            <para><programlisting>eth0 -dontroute -phase 2 -net 0-65534 -addr 65280.152
eth1 -dontroute -phase 2 -net 0-65534 -addr 65280.208
eth2 -dontroute -phase 2 -net 1-1000 -addr 10.142 -zone "Printers"</programlisting>
            On eth0 and eth1, there are no other routers present, so atalkd
            chooses an address from within the startup range. But on eth2
            there lives an already connected AppleTalk router, publishing one
            zone called "Printers" and forcing clients to assign themselves an
            address in a netrange between 1 and 1000.</para>
          </example>

          <para>In this case, atalkd will handle each interface as it would be
          the only active one. This can have some side effects when it comes
          to the point where AFP clients want to do the magic switch from
          AppleTalk to TCP, so use this with caution.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In case, you have more than one active network interface and do
      not take special precautions as outlined above, then autoconfiguration
      of the interfaces might fail in a situation where one of your network
      interfaces is connected to a network where <emphasis>no</emphasis> other
      active AppleTalk router is present and supplies appropriate routing
      settings.</para>

        </indexterm></title>

      <para>There exist several types of AppleTalk routers: seed, non-seed and
      so called soft-seed routers.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A seed router has its own configuration and publishes this
          into the network segments it is configured for.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A non-seed router needs a seed router on the interface to
          which it is connected to learn the network configuration. So this
          type of AppleTalk router can work completely without manual
          configuration.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A so called soft-seed router is exactly the same as a non-seed
          router except the fact, that it can also remember the configuration
          of a seed router and act as a replacement in case, the real seed
          router disappears from the net.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Netatalk's atalkd can act as both a seed and a soft-seed router,
      even in a mixed mode, where it acts on one interface in this way and on
      the other in another.</para>

      <para>If you leave your atalkd.conf completely empty or simply add all
      active interfaces line by line without using seed settings (atalkd will
      act identically in both cases), then atalkd is forced to act as a
      soft-seed router on each interface, so it will fail on the first
      interface, where no seed router is accessible to fetch routing
      information from.</para>

      <para>In this case, other services, that depend on atalkd, might also
      fail.</para>

      <para>So you should have atalkd act as a seed router on one or all
      active interfaces. A seed router has to supply informations
      about:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The specific netrange on this segment</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Its own AppleTalk address</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The zones (one to many) available in this segment</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The so called "default zone" for this segment</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <warning>
        <para>Unless you are the network admin yourself, consider asking
        her/him before changing anything related to AppleTalk routing, as
        changing these settings might have side effects for all of your
        AppleTalk network clients!</para>
      </warning>

      <para>In an AppleTalk network netranges have to be unique and must not
      overlap each other. Fortunately netatalk's atalkd is polite enough to
      check whether your settings are in conflict with already existing ones
      on the net. In such a case it simply discards your settings and tries to
      adapt the already established ones on the net (if in doubt, always check
      syslog for details).</para>

      <para>Netranges, you can use, include pretty small ones, eg. 42-42, to
      very large ones, eg. 1-65279 - the latter one representing the maximum.
      In routed environments you can use any numbers in the range between 1
      and 65279 unless they do not overlap with settings of other connected
      subnets.</para>

      <para>The own AppleTalk address consists of a net part and a node part
      (the former 16 bit, the latter 8 bit, for example 12057.143). Apple
      recommends using node addresses of 128 or above for servers, letting
      client Macs assign themselves an address faster (as they will primarily
      search for a node address within 1-127 in the supplied netrange). As we
      don't want to get in conflict with Apple servers, we prefer using node
      addresses of 142 or above.</para>

      <para>AppleTalk zones have <emphasis>nothing</emphasis> to do with
      physical networks. They're just a hint for your client's convenience,
      letting them locate network resources in a more comfortable/faster way.
      You can either use one zone name across multiple physical segments as
      well as more than one zone name on a single segment (and various
      combinations of this).</para>

      <para>So all you have to do is to <emphasis>draw a network
      chart</emphasis> containing the physical segments, the netranges you
      want to assign to each one, the zone names you want to publish in which
      segments and the default zone per segment (this is always the first zone
      name, you supply with the "-zone" switch in atalkd.conf).</para>

      <para>Given, you finished the steps outlined above, you might want to
      edit atalkd.conf to fit your needs.</para>

      <para>You'll have to set the following options in atalkd.conf:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>-net (use reasonable values between 1-65279 for each
          interface)</para>

          <para>In case, this value is suppressed but -addr is present, the
          netrange from this specific address will be used</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>-addr (the net part must match the -net settings if present,
          the node address should be between 142 and 255)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>-zone (can be used multiple times in one single line, the
          first entry is the default zone)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Note that you are able to set up "zone mapping", that means
      publishing exactly the same zone name on all AppleTalk segments, as well
      as providing more than one single zone name per interface. Dumb
      AppleTalk devices, like LaserWriters, will always register themselves in
      the default zone (the first zone entry you use in atalkd.conf per
      interface), more intelligent ones will have the ability to choose one
      specific zone via a user interface.</para>

      <example>
        <title>atalkd.conf making netatalk a seed router on two
        interfaces</title>

        <para><programlisting>eth0 -seed -phase 2 -net 1-1000 -addr 1000.142 -zone "Printers" -zone "Spoolers"
eth1 -seed -phase 2 -net 1001-2000 -addr 2000.142 -zone "Macs" -zone "Servers"</programlisting>
        The settings for eth0 force AppleTalk devices within the connected
        network to assign themselves an address in the netrange 1-1000. Two
        zone names are published into this segment, "Printers" being the so
        called "standard zone", forcing dumb AppleTalk devices like Laser
        printers to show up automatically into this zone. AppleTalk printer
        queues supplied by netatalk's papd can be registered into the zone
        "Spoolers" simply by adjusting the settings in <citerefentry>
            <refentrytitle>papd.conf</refentrytitle>

            <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
          </citerefentry>. On eth1 we use the different and non-overlapping
        netrange 1001-2000, set the default zone to "Macs" and publish a
        fourth zone name "Servers".</para>
      </example>

      <example>
        <title>atalkd.conf configured for "zone mapping"</title>

        <para><programlisting>eth0 -seed -phase 2 -net 1-1000 -addr 1000.142 -zone "foo"
lo0 -phase 1 -net 1 -addr 1.142 -zone "foo"</programlisting> We use the same
        network settings as in the example above but let atalkd publish the
        same zone name on both segments. As the same zone name will be used on
        all segments of the AppleTalk network no zone names will show up at
        all... but AppleTalk routing will still be active. In this case, we
        connect a so called "non-extended" LocalTalk network (phase 1) to an
        EtherTalk "extended" network (phase 2) transparently.</para>
      </example>

      <example>
        <title>atalkd.conf for a soft-seed router configuration</title>

        <para><programlisting>eth0 eth1 eth2</programlisting> As we have more
        than one interface, atalkd will try to act as an AppleTalk router
        between both segments. As we don't supply any network configuration on
        our own we depend on the availability of seed routers in every
        connected segment. If only one segment is without such an available
        seed router the whole thing will fail.</para>
      </example>

      <example>
        <title>atalkd.conf for a soft-seed router configuration after atalkd
        started</title>

        <para><programlisting>eth0 -phase 2 -net 10-10 -addr 10.166 -zone "Parking"
eth1 -phase 2 -net 10000-11000 -addr 10324.151 -zone "No Parking" -zone "Parking"
eth2 -phase 2 -net 65279-65279 -addr 65279.142 -zone "Parking" -zone "No Parking"</programlisting>
        In this case, active seed routers are present in all three connected
        networks, so atalkd was able to fetch the network configuration from
        them and, since the settings do not conflict, act as a soft-seed
        router from now on between the segments. So even in case, all of the
        three seed routers would disappear from the net, atalkd would still
        supply the connected network with the network configuration once
        learned from them. Only in case, atalkd would be restarted afterwards,
        the routing information will be lost (as we're not acting as seed
        router).</para>
      </example>

      <example>
        <title>atalkd.conf ready for mixed seed/soft-seed mode</title>

        <para><programlisting>eth0
eth1 -seed -phase 2 -net 99-100 -addr 99.200 -zone "Testing"</programlisting>
        In case in the network connected to eth0 lives no active seed router
        or one with a mismatching configuration (eg. an overlapping netrange
        of 1-200) atalkd will fail. Otherwise it will fetch the configuration
        from this machine and will route between eth0 and eth1, on the latter
        acting as a seed router itself.</para>
      </example>

      <para>By the way: It is perfectly legal to have more than one seed
      router connected to a network segment. But in this case, you should take
      care that the configuration of all connected routers is exactly the same
      regarding netranges, published zone names and also the "standard zone"
      per segment</para>

    <para>The "Printer Access Protocol" as part of the AppleTalk protocol
    suite is a fully 8 bit aware and bidirectional printing protocol,
    developed by Apple in 1985. <emphasis>8 bit aware</emphasis> means that
    the whole set of bytes can be used for printing (binary encoding). This
    has been a great advantage compared with other protocols like Adobe's
    Standard Protocol to drive serial and parallel PostScript printers
    (compare with <ulink
    url="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/ps/specifications.jsp">Adobe
    TechNote 5009</ulink>) or LPR<indexterm>
        <primary>LPR</primary>

        <secondary>Remote Line Printer Protocol</secondary>
      </indexterm> which made only use of the lower 128 bytes for printing
    because the 8th bit has been reserved for control codes.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Bidirectional</emphasis> means that printing source
    (usually a Macintosh computer) and destination (a printer or spooler
    implementation) communicate about both destination's capabilities via
    feature queries (compare with <ulink
    url="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/ps/archive.jsp">Adobe TechNote
    5133</ulink>) and device status. This allows the LaserWriter driver on the
    Macintosh to generate appropriate device specific PostScript code (color
    or b/w, only embedding needed fonts, and so on) on the one hand and
    notifications about the printing process or problems (paper jam for
    example) on the other.</para>

      <para>Netatalk's <command>papd</command> is able to provide AppleTalk
      printing services for Macintoshes or, to be more precise, PAP clients in
      general. Netatalk does not contain a full-blown spooler implementation
      itself, papd only handles the bidirectional communication and
      submittance of printjobs from PAP clients. So normally one needs to
      integrate papd with a Unix printing system like eg. classic SysV

      <para>Since it is so important to answer the client's feature queries
      correctly, how does papd achieve this? By parsing the relevant keywords

          <primary>PPD</primary>

      <para>Netatalk formerly had built-in support for System V lpd printing
      in a way that papd saved the printed job directly into the spooldir and
      calls <command>lpd</command> afterwards, to pick up the file and do the
      rest. Due to incompatibilities with many lpd implementations the normal
      behaviour was to print directly into a pipe instead of specifying a
      printer by name and using lpd interaction. With Netatalk 2.0 another
      alternative has been implemented: direct interaction with CUPS (Note:
      when CUPS support is compiled in, then the SysV lpd support doesn't work
      at all). Detailed examples can be found in the <citerefentry>

        The file <filename>/usr/share/doc/gs/examples/tiger.ps</filename> is
        sent to a printer called "ColorLaserWriter 16/600" in the standard
        zone "*". The device type is "LaserWriter" (can be suppressed since it
        is the default).</para>

        is used to convert a PostScript job to PCL3 output suitable for a
        Color DeskWriter. Since no file has been supplied on the command line,
        <command>pap</command> reads the data from stdin. The printer's
        address will be read from the <filename>.paprc</filename> file in the
        same directory, <command>pap</command> will be called (in our example
        simply containing "Color DeskWriter:DeskWriter@Printers"). The
        <option>-E</option> switch forces <command>pap</command> to not wait
        for an EOF from the printer.</para>

    <title>Starting and stopping Netatalk</title>

    <para>The Netatalk distribution comes with several operating system
    specific startup script templates that are tailored according to the
    options given to the "configure" script before compiling. Currently,
    templates are provided for RedHat (sysv style), RedHat (systemd style),
    SuSE, Gentoo, NetBSD and Debian. You can select to install the generated
    startup script(s)
    <indexterm>
        <primary>Startscript</primary>

        <secondary>startup script</secondary>
      </indexterm> by specifying a system type to "configure". To
    automatically install startup scripts for e.g. the Ubuntu distribution
    try to give the <option>--enable-debian</option> option to "configure". Some
    of the scripts can be further parametrized by the configuration file
    netatalk.conf (described in the <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>netatalk.conf</refentrytitle>

        <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry> manual page), some obtain that information in another,
    operating system specific way (like NetBSD, Debian and so on).</para>

    <para>Since new releases of Linux distributions appear all the time and
    the startup procedure for the other systems mentioned above might change
    as well, it is probably a good idea to not blindly install a startup
    script but to look at it first to see if it will work on your system. If
    you use Netatalk as part of a fixed setup, like a Linux distribution, an
    RPM or a BSD package, things will probably have been arranged properly for
    you. The following therefore applies mostly for people who have compiled
    Netatalk themselves.</para>

    <para>The following daemons need to be started by whatever startup script
    mechanism is used:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>atalkd<indexterm>
            <primary>atalkd</primary>
          </indexterm> (if you use the AppleTalk protocol)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>papd<indexterm>
            <primary>papd</primary>
          </indexterm> (if you want to provide print services via
        AppleTalk)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>timelord<indexterm>
            <primary>timelord</primary>
          </indexterm> (for old style time synchronisation via
        AppleTalk)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>a2boot<indexterm>
            <primary>a2boot</primary>
          </indexterm> (Apple II boot server via AppleTalk, not necessary any
        longer)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>cnid_metad<indexterm>
            <primary>cnid_metad</primary>
          </indexterm> (if the dbd CNID backend is used)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>afpd<indexterm>
            <primary>afpd</primary>
          </indexterm></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Additionally, make sure that the various configuration files
    (<filename>afpd.conf</filename>,
    <filename>AppleVolumes.default</filename>, <filename>papd.conf</filename>
    etc.) are in the right place and that
    <filename>netatalk.conf</filename><indexterm>
        <primary>netatalk.conf</primary>
      </indexterm> (if used) contains the right entries. If you want e.g. papd
    to be started using this mechanism, set the environment variable
    "<option>PAPD_RUN</option>"<indexterm>
        <primary>PAPD_RUN</primary>
      </indexterm> to "yes" in netatalk.conf. See the manual pages for
    details.</para>
