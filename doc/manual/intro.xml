  <title>Overview of Netatalk</title>

  <para>Netatalk is an Open Source software package that can be used to turn
  a *NIX machine into an extremely light-weight and
  versatile file server for Macintosh computers. It speaks both AFP over TCP
  as well as the legacy AppleTalk protocol, which means it can act as a bridge between
  older Macs, networked Apple IIs, and the very latest macOS systems.</para>

  <para>Netatalk is AFP 3.3 compliant with AFP 2 backwards compatibility.
  Its file server offers high transmission speeds and full
  support for Macintosh metadata (resource forks), while offering a wide range of
  authentication methods to accommodate any deployment environment.</para>

  <para>The included print server daemon can provide Apple II and Macintosh clients
  with the ability to print to AppleTalk-only printers.
  In addition, Netatalk is fully integrated with CUPS, allowing any networked Mac
  to discover and print to a CUPS/AirPrint compatible printer on the network.</para>

  <para>Additionally, Netatalk can be used to act as an AppleTalk router,
  providing both segmentation and zone names in traditional Macintosh networks.
