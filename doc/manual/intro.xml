    <title>Overview of Netatalk</title>

    <para>Netatalk is an Open Source software package that can be used to turn
    a *NIX machine into a fast, light-weight and reliable file server for
    Macintosh computers.</para>

    <para>Using Netatalk's AFP 3.4 compliant file-server leads to
    significantly higher transmission speeds for older Macs compared to
    Samba/NFS, while providing clients with the best possible user experience:
    full support for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed
    environments of classic Mac OS and OS X clients.</para>

    <para>It ships with range of authentication methods to accommodate any
    deployment environment. Modern macOS features such as Bonjour service
    discovery, Time Machine backups, and Spotlight indexed search are also
    supported.</para>
