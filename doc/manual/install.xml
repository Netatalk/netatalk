            (a.k.a. DHX) UAM, which provides the strongest password encryption

            sharing and Time Machine volumes by using Avahi or
            mDNSResponder.</para>

            <para>LDAP is an open and industry-standard user directory
            protocol that works in tandem with the advanced permissions scheme
            of ACL. On some operating systems ACL and LDAP libraries are built
            in to the system, while on others you have to install supporting
            packages to enable this functionality.</para>

            <para>By leveraging a MySQL-compatible client library, netatalk
            can be built with a MySQL CNID backend that is highly scalable and

            <para>iconv</para>

            <para>iconv provides conversion routines for many character
            encodings. Netatalk uses it to provide charsets it does not have
            built in conversions for, like ISO-8859-1. On glibc systems,
            Netatalk can use the glibc provided iconv implementation.
            Otherwise you can use the GNU libiconv implementation.</para>

      <para>Instructions on how to use the build system to configure and build
      netatalk source code are documented in the <ulink

      file in the Netatalk source tree.</para>

      <para>For examples of concrete steps to compile on specific operating
      systems, refer to the <link linkend="compile">Compile Netatalk from
      Source</link> appendix in this manual, which is automatically generated
      from the CI build scripts.</para>

    <title>Starting and stopping Netatalk</title>

    <para>The Netatalk distribution comes with several operating system
    specific startup script templates that are tailored according to the
    options given to the build system before compiling. Currently, templates
    are provided for systemd, openrc, in addition to platform specific scripts
    for popular Linux distributions, BSD variants, Solaris descendants, and
    macOS.</para>

    <para>When building from source, you can configure the build system to
    install the generated startup script(s) <indexterm>
        <primary>Startscript</primary>

        <secondary>startup script</secondary>
      </indexterm> you want by specifying an <option>with-init-style</option>
    option. For the specific syntax, please refer to the build system's help
    text.</para>

    <para>Since new releases of Linux distributions appear all the time and
    the startup procedure for the other systems mentioned above might change
    as well, it is probably a good idea to not blindly install a startup
    script but to confirm first that it will work on your system.</para>

    <para>If you use Netatalk as part of a fixed setup, like a Linux
    distribution, an RPM or a BSD package, things will probably have been
    arranged properly for you. The previous paragraphs therefore apply mostly
    for people who have compiled Netatalk themselves.</para>

    <para>The following daemon need to be started by whatever startup script
    mechanism is used:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>

            <primary>netatalk</primary>
          </indexterm></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In the absence of a startup script, you can also launch this daemon
    directly (as root), and kill it with SIGTERM when you are done with
    it.</para>

    <para>Additionally, make sure that the configuration file
    <filename>afp.conf</filename> is in the right place. You can inquire
    netatalk where it is expecting the file to be by running the
    <userinput>netatalk -V</userinput> command.</para>
