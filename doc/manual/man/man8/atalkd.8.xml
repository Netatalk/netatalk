    <title>Description</title>

    <para><command>atalkd</command> is responsible for all user level
    AppleTalk network management. This includes routing, name registration and
    lookup, zone lookup, and the AppleTalk Echo Protocol (similar to
    <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>ping</refentrytitle>

        <manvolnum>8</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>). <command>atalkd</command> is typically started at boot
    time, out of <filename>/etc/rc</filename>. It first reads from its
    configuration file, <filename>:ETCDIR:/atalkd.conf</filename>. If there is
    no configuration file, <command>atalkd</command> will attempt to configure
    all available interfaces and will create a configuration file. The file
    consists of a series of interfaces, one per line. Lines with `#' in the
    first column are ignored, as are blank lines. The syntax is</para>

    <para><emphasis remap="I">interface</emphasis> [ <option>-seed</option> ]
    [ <option>-phase</option> <replaceable>number</replaceable> ] [
    <option>-net</option> <replaceable>net-range</replaceable> ] [
    <option>-addr</option> <replaceable>address</replaceable> ] [
    <option>-zone</option> <replaceable>zonename</replaceable> ] ...</para>

    <para>Note that all fields except the interface are optional. The loopback
    interface is configured automatically. If <option>-seed</option> is
    specified, all other fields must be present. Also,
    <command>atalkd</command> will exit during bootstrapÂ­ping, if a router
    disagrees with its seed information. If <option>-seed</option> is not
    given, all other information may be overriden during auto-configuration.
    If no <option>-phase</option> option is given, the default phase as given
    on the command line is used (the default is 2). If <option>-addr</option>
    is given and <option>-net</option> is not, a net-range of one is
    assumed.</para>

    <para>The first -zone directive for each interface is the ``default''
    zone. Under Phase 1, there is only one zone. Under Phase 2, all routers on
    the network are configured with the default zone and must agree.
    <command>atalkd</command> maps ``*'' to the default zone of the first
    interface. Note: The default zone for a machine is determined by the
    configuration of the local routers; to appear in a non-default zone, each
    service, e.g. <command>afpd</command>, must individually specify the
    desired zone. See also <citerefentry>

    <title>Routing</title>

    <para>If you are connecting a netatalk router to an existing AppleTalk
    internet, you should first contact your local network administrators to
    obtain appropriate network addresses.</para>

    <para><command>atalkd</command> can provide routing between interfaces by
    configuring multiple interfaces. Each interface must be assigned a unique
    net-range<indexterm>
        <primary>net-range</primary>

        <secondary>AppleTalk net-range</secondary>
      </indexterm> between 1 and 65279 (0 and 65535 are illegal, and addresses
    between 65280 and 65534 are reserved for startup). It is best to choose
    the smallest useful net-range, i.e. if you have three machines on an
    Ethernet, don't chose a net-range of 1000-2000. Each net-range may have an
    arbitrary list of zones associated with it.</para>

    <title>Examples</title>

    <para>Below is an example configuration file for a sun4/40. The machine
    has two interfaces, ``le0'' and ``le1''. The ``le0'' interface is
    configured automatically from other routers on the network. The machine is
    the only router for the ``le1'' interface.</para>

    <para><programlisting>   le0
   le1 -seed -net 9461-9471 -zone netatalk -zone Argus</programlisting><command>atalkd</command>
    automatically acts as a router if there is more than one interface.</para>
