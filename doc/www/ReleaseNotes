Netatalk 3.1.0
==============

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce the first release of
the Netatalk 3.1 release series. Early adopters are encouraged to update
production systems.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP).

The suite contains:

* netatalk   - the main server service controller
* afpd       - the AFP file server daemin
* cnid_metad - the CNID database multiplexing daemon
* cnid_dbd   - the CNID database daemon serving CNIDs for AFP volumes
* various supporting programs and utilities

Summary of major new features and enhancements in 3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* AFP Spotlight Support with Gnome Tracker:
  https://projects.gnome.org/tracker/

Please refer to the online manual for details about compiling Netatalk
with Spotlight support and how to configure:

* UPD: Don't force S_ISGID for directories on FreeBSD. Bug #525.
* NEW: Add support for ZFS ACLs on FreeBSD with libsunacl. From FR#83.

* FIX: Small fix in the DSI tickle handling. Bug #528.
* UPD: Enhance handling of connection attempts when hitting the
       connection limit. Bug #529.
* FIX: Saving from Word to a folder that is a symlink to a folder on
       another filesystem results in a crash of the afpd process and
       the save to fail. This happens only if the option
       "follow symlinks" is enabled. Bug #532.

Changes in 3.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIX: Fix a crash when using pam_winbind. Fixes bug #516.
* NEW: New global/volume option "ignored attributes"
* FIX: "afp listen" option failed to take IPv6 addresses. Bug #515.
* FIX: Fix a possible crash in set_groups. Bug #518.
* NEW: Send optional AFP messages for vetoed files, new option
       "veto messages" can be used to enable sending messages.

       with a vetoed name, it will be sent an AFP message indicating
       the name and the directory. From FR #81.
* NEW: New boolean volume option "delete veto files". If this option is
       set to yes, then Netatalk will attempt to recursively delete any
       vetoed files and directories. FR #82.
* UPD: systemd unit dir is /usr/lib/systemd/system .
* FIX: Saving files from application like MS Word may result in the file
       loosing metadata like the Finder label. Bug #521.

Changes in 3.0.4

* FIX: Fix an issue with filenames containing non-ASCII characters that
       lead to a failure setting the size of a files ressource fork.
       This affected application like Adobe Photoshop where saving
       files may fail. Fixes bug #511.
* UPD: Enhance ACL mapping, change global ACL option 'map acl' to take
       the following options: "none", "rights" (default), "mode".
       none   = no mapping, this resembles the previous false/no setting
       rights = map ACLs to Finder UARights, this resembles the previous
                true/yes setting. This is the default.
       mode   = map ACLs to Finder UARights and UNIX mode
       From FR #73.
* FIX: Fix a possible crash in cname() where cname_mtouname calls
       dirlookup() where the curdir is freed because the dircache
       detected a dev/inode cache difference and evicted the object
       from the cache. Fixes bug #498.
* FIX: Add missing include, fixes bug #512.
* FIX: Change default FinderInfo for directories to be all 0, fixes
       bug 514.
* NEW: New option "afp interfaces" which allows specifying where
       Netatalk listens for AFP connections by interface names.

       $sysconfdir/pam.d/. Add configure option --with-pam-confdir
       to specify alternative path.
* NEW: AFP stats about active session via dbus IPC. Client side python
       program `afpstats`. Requires dbus, dbus-glib any python-dbus.
       configure option --dbus-sysconf-dir for specifying dbus
       system security configuration files.
       New option 'afpstats' (default: no) which determines whether

       Fixes bug #496.

Changes in 3.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW: afpd: Put file extension type/creator mapping back in which had
       been removed in 3.0.
* NEW: afpd: new option 'ad domain'. From FR #66.
* FIX: volumes and home share with symlinks in the path
* FIX: Copying packages to a Netatalk share could fail, bug #469
* FIX: Reloading volumes from config file was broken.  Fixes bug #474.

       Fixes bug #479.
* REM: Remove TimeMachine volume used size FCE event.
* UPD: Add quoting support to '[in]valid users' option. Fixes bug #472.
* FIX: Install working PAM config on Solaris 11. Fixes bug #481.
* FIX: Fix a race condition between dbd and the cnid_dbd daemon
       which could result in users being disconnected from volumes
       when dbd was scanning their volumes. Fixes bug #477.
* FIX: Netatalk didn't start when the last line of the config file
       afp.conf wasn't terminated by a newline. Fixes bug #476.
* NEW: Add a new volumes option 'follow symlinks'. The default setting is
       false, symlinks are not followed on the server. This is the same
       behaviour as OS X's AFP server.
       Setting the option to true causes afpd to follow symlinks on the
       server. symlinks may point outside of the AFP volume, currently
       afpd doesn't do any checks for "wide symlinks".
* FIX: Automatic AppleDouble conversion to EAs failing for directories.
       Fixes bug #486.
* FIX: dbd failed to convert appledouble files of symlinks.
       Fixes bug #490.

       --with-libevent-header|lib.

       reservation locking primitives. Enabled by default, set global
       "solaris share reservations" option to false to disable it.
* NEW: ad: ad set subcommand for changing Mac metadata on the server

       vol charset is same value as unix charset by default

       automatically moved
* FIX: afpd: Server info packet was malformed resulting in broken
       server names being displayed on clients
* FIX: afpd: Byte order detection. Fixes an error where Netatalk on
