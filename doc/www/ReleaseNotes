Netatalk 2.2.5
==============

The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 2.2.5 of
the Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the latest update to the 2.2
release series. All users are encouraged to upgrade their systems to 2.2.5.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. It also
provides a kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite.
A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh
clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP), AppleTalk
router, *NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk printers via
Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities.

The suite contains:

* afpd - a file server that implements the Apple Filing Protocol, allowing
  clients running MacOS to access Unix file servers
* atalkd - an implementation of the AppleTalk protocol
* papd - a print server that enables Macintosh computers to access printers
  connected to Unix servers
* megatron - a tool to convert files in Macintosh specific formats like
  BinHex, AppleSingle, or MacBinary into files readable by Unix computers
* various supporting programs and utilities

Summary of hot stuff and enhancements in 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* AFP 3.3 support (necessary for TimeMachine and Lion)
* Robust network disconnect/reconnect, especially important for Time Machine
* Support for fast AFP searches (CNID backend "dbd" only)
* POSIX draft 1e ACL support
* Complete Netatalk volume compatible `ad` file utility suite
* Dynamic filesystem cache
* Builtin Zeroconf registration of the AFP server and TimeMachine volumes
* Support for ACLs without a common Directory Service between server and client

Important
~~~~~~~~~

The enhancements for fast AFP searches are only implemented for the CNID backend "dbd"
and require changes to the underlying CNID database, ie an additional index.
This breaks drop-in compatibility between the CNID backends "cdb" and "dbd". Once "dbd"
has upgraded a CNID database of a volume, "cdb" will reject to open it.

Changes in 2.2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIX: Fix errors searching volumes
* NEW: Configurable symlink handling with a new volume option
       'followsymlinks'. Setting the option causes afpd to follow
       symlinks on the server side.
* UPD: Reload groups when reloading volumes. FR #71.
* FIX: Fix a possible crash in cname() where cname_mtouname calls
       dirlookup() where the curdir is freed because the dircache
       detected a dev/inode cache difference and evicted the object
       from the cache. Fixes bug #498.
* FIX: Change default FinderInfo for directories to be all 0, fixes
       bug 514.

Changes in 2.2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* FIX: Missing UAM links
* FIX: Lockup in AFP logout on Fedora 17
* FIX: Reset signal handlers and alarm timer after successfull PAM
       authentication. Fixes a problem with AFP disconnects caused
       by pam_smbpass.so messing with our handlers and timer.
* FIX: afpd: Fix a possible problem with sendfile on Solaris derived
       platforms

Changes in 2.2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW: afpd: support for mdnsresponder
* NEW: afpd: new LDAP config option ldap_uuid_string
* UPD: based on Unicode 6.1.0
* UPD: experimental systemd service files: always run both afpd and cnid_metad
* UPD: afpd: Ensure our umask is not altered by eg pam_umask
* UPD: afpd: Use GSS_C_NO_NAME as server principal when Kerberos options -fqdn
       and -krb5service are not set, from Jamie Gilbertson
* UPD: afpd: Changed behaviour for TimeMachine volumes in case there's a problem
       talking to the CNID daemons. Previously the volume was flagged read-only
       and an AFP message was sent to the client. As this might result in
       TimeMachine assuming the backup sparse bundle is damaged, we now just
       switch the CNID database to an in-memory tdb without the additional stuff.
* FIX: afpd: sendfile() on FreeBSD was broken, courtesy of Denis Ahrens
* FIX: afpd: Dont use searchdb when doing partial name search
* FIX: afpd: Fix a possible bug handling disconnected sessions,
       NetAFP Bug ID #16
* FIX: afpd: Close IPC fds in afpd session child inherited from the afpd
       master process
* FIX: dbd: Don't remove BerkeleyDB if it's still in use by eg cnid_dbd, fixes
       bug introduced in 2.2.2
* FIX: debian initscript: start avahi-daemon (if available) before atalkd
* FIX: Zeroconf could not advertise non-ASCII time machine volume name

Changes in 2.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW: afpd: New option "adminauthuser". Specifying eg "-adminauthuser root"
       whenever a normal user login fails, afpd tries to authenticate as
       the specified adminauthuser. If this succeeds, a normal session is
       created for the original connecting user. Said differently: if you
       know the password of adminauthuser, you can authenticate as any other
       user.
* NEW: configure option "--enable-suse-systemd" for openSUSE12.1 and later.
       "--enable-redhat-systemd" and "--enable-suse-systemd" are same as
       "--enable-systemd".
       "--enable-suse" is renamed "--enable-suse-sysv".
* NEW: experimental systemd service files in distrib/systemd/
* UPD: afpd: Enhanced POSIX ACL mapping semantics, from Laura Mueller
* UPD: afpd: Reset options every time a :DEFAULT: line is found in a
       AppleVolumes file
* UPD: afpd: Convert passwords from legacy encoding (wire format) to host
       encoding, NetAFP Bug ID #14
* UPD: afpd: Don't set ATTRBIT_SHARED flag for directories
* UPD: afpd: Use sendfile() on Solaris and FreeBSD for sending data
* UPD: afpd: Faster volume used size calculation for "volsizelimit" option,
       cf man AppleVolume.default for details
* FIX: afpd: ACL access checking
* FIX: afpd: Fix an error when duplicating files that lacked an AppleDouble
       file which lead to a possible Finder crash
* FIX: afpd: Read-only filesystems lead to afpd processes running as root
* FIX: afpd: Fix for filesystem without NFSv4 ACL support on Solaris
* FIX: afpd: Fix catsearch bug, NetAFP Bug ID #12
* FIX: afpd: Fix dircache bug, NetAFP Bug ID #13
* FIX: dbd: Better checking for duplicated or bogus CNIDs from AppleDouble
       files
* FIX: dbd: Remove BerkeleyDB database environment after running `dbd`. This
       is crucial for the automatic BerkeleyDB database upgrade feature which
       is built into cnid_dbd and dbd.
* FIX: Fix compilation error when AppleTalk support is disabled
* FIX: Portability fixes
* FIX: search of surrogate pair

Changes in 2.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* NEW: afpd: disable continous service feature by default, new option
       -keepsessions to enable it
* NEW: configure option "--enable-redhat-systemd" for Fedora15 and later.
       "--enable-redhat" is renamed "--enable-redhat-sysv".
* UPD: afpd: Enhance ACL support detection for volumes: enable them per volume
       if
       1) ACL support compiled in, 2) the volume supports ACLs, 3) the new
       volume option "noacls" is not set for the volume.
       The previous behaviour was to enable ACL support for a volume if
       1) it was compiled in and 2) the volume supported ACLs. There was no way
       to disable ACLs for a volume.
* UPD: afpd: add a configurable hold time option to FCE file modification event
       generation, default is 60 s, new option "fceholdfmod" to change it

       established
* FIX: afpd: fix a crash when searching for a UUID that is not a special
       local UUID and LDAP support is not compiled in
* FIX: afpd: .volinfo file not created on first volume access if user in rolist
* FIX: afpd: possible crash at startup when registering with Avahi
       when Avahi is not running
* FIX: afpd: return correct user/group type when mapping UUIDs to names
* FIX: afpd: for directories add DARWIN_ACE_DELETE ACE
       if DARWIN_ACE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY is set
* FIX: afpd: afpd crashed when it failed to register with Avahi because eg
       user service registration is disabled in the Avahi config
* FIX: dbd: function checking and removing malformed ad:ea header files failed
       to chdir back to the original working directory
* FIX: cnid_dbd: increase BerkeleyDB locks and lockobjs
* FIX: cnid_dbd: implement -d option, deletes CNID db
* FIX: dbd: better detection of local (or SMB/NFS) modifications on AFP volumes
* FIX: suse: initscript return better status

* UPD: afpd: new option "searchdb" which enables fast catalog searches
       using the CNID db.
* UPD: Case-insensitive fast search with the CNID db
