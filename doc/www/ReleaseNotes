The Netatalk development team is proud to announce version 3.0.7 of
the Netatalk File Sharing suite. This is the latest update to the 3.0
release series. All users are encouraged to upgrade their systems to 3.0.7.

Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver.

clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP).

The suite contains:

* netatalk   - the main server service controller
* afpd       - the AFP file server daemin
* cnid_metad - the CNID database multiplexing daemon
* cnid_dbd   - the CNID database daemon serving CNIDs for AFP volumes
* various supporting programs and utilities

Summary of major new features and enhancements in 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New ini style configuration file afp.conf which replaces all previous
  configuration files
* New default AppleDouble backend using filesystem Extended Attributes,
  conversion from AppleDouble v2 is done automatically on access
* New service controller process "netatalk" responsible for starting and
  restarting afpd and cnid_metad as necessary
* AppleTalk support has been removed
* Coherent cross-platform locking with Solaris CIFS server
