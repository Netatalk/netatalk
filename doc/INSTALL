Basic Installation
==================

Netatalk is known to run on at least five operating systems:

	OS	Versions	Hardware	Notes
	--	--------	--------	-----
	Solaris	2.5-8		Sparc
	Linux	1.3.x,2.x	PC
	FreeBSD	2.2-current	PC		after 12 Sept 96
	NetBSD	1.3		PC
	OpenBSD	2.2		PC
	SunOS	4.1+		Sparc		kernel must have VDDRV
						option installed
	Ultrix	4.[1-4]		3100,5000
	Tru64	4.0		Alpha		afpd only

See ./doc/README.platforms for more information.

Quickly:
$> ./autogen.sh   (only needed for installs from CVS)
$> ./configure [options]
$> make
$> make install


----------------------------------------------------------------
0. Get the source

A. Download a binary. Several Linux distributions support netatalk
with a package. There are also Deb's and RPM packages available on the
the Netatalk Sourceforge
site. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/netatalk/)

B. Download the tarball. There are tar.gz and tar.bz2 files available
for download and compiling.
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/netatalk/)

C. Anonymous CVS. Downloading of the CVS source can be done quickly
and easily.

1. make sure you have cvs installed. 
$> which cvs 
should produce a path to cvs.

2. if you don't have one make a source directory. Mine is
~lance/src/working/ cd to this directory.

3. Authenticate yourself with your local cvs and the remote cvs: (all
one line)

cvs \
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.netatalk.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/netatalk \
login

Just hit enter for the password for the anonymous user.

4. Now that both machines know who you are, get the source: (all one
line)

cvs -z3 \
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.netatalk.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/netatalk \
co netatalk

This tells cvs what compression, (-z3) what protocol, repository and
where the source is (-d:protocol:host:path) what to do (co is an alias
for checkout) and what (netatalk) module.

This will create a netatalk directory and download a complete and
fresh copy of the netatalk source


----------------------------------------------------------------

1. ./autogen.sh (Not necessary for a release tarball.)
This shell script runs libtoolize, aclocal, autoheader, automake and
autoconf. This sets up all the conditions for the next step. You may
or may not have to do this. If you downloaded a release tarball, or if
your download contains a ./configure file then this has already been
run for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2. ./configure 
This step reads the options to the ./configure program and checks your
system against the requirements of those options. It generally fails
if your system doesn't meet the requirements. You should read check
the DEVELOPER file because some of these options require external
sources to function correctly. (PAM, SSL, Berkeley DB3, TCP Wrappers,
etc).

Netatalk options to the ./configure script: Use ./configure --help for
a complete list.

--disable-admin-group: disable admin group (default on),

--disable-ddp: disable DDP support (AppleTalk),

--enable-debug: enable debugging messages in syslog,

--enable-dropkludge: enable the experimental dropbox fix
	(INSECURE!),

--with-db3=PATH: specify path to Berkeley DB3 installation,

--with-did=[scheme]: set DID scheme (last,mtab,cnid),
	The last DID scheme recreates version 37b behaviour where
	directory id's are incrementally calculated versus the new
	hash method. Unfortunately for machines that have a lot of
	devices, and/or a lot of inodes the hash can fail with
	multiple directories resolving to the same DID.

	cnid is a new and experimental scheme using Berkeley DB3 files
	to store a per-volume cnid database persistently.

--with-message-dir=path: path to message files [default is DISABLED],

--enable-srvloc: Turn on Server Location Protocol support,

--with-pam: enable pluggable authentication modules support,
	PAM provides a flexible mechanism for authenticating
	users. PAM was invented by SUN Microsystems.

	Linux-PAM is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local
	system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
	You can get the Linux PAM documentation and sources from
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/

--with-shadow: enable shadow password support,

--disable-shell-check: disable checking for a valid shell,

--with-flock-locks: enable flock locks support,

--with-tcp-wrappers: enable TCP wrappers support.
	Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or
	LOG_TCP. These programs log the client host name of incoming
	telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin, finger etc. requests. Security
	options are: access control per host, domain and/or service;
	detection of host name spoofing or host address spoofing;
	booby traps to implement an early-warning system.  TCP
	Wrappers can be gotten at
	ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/

--with-ssl-dirs=[PATH]: specify path to OpenSSL installation. 
	NOTE: This is dependent on the same directory layout as the
	source distribution of Openssl. That is: ./include/ and
	./lib/ to be on the same level. Many .rpm formats do not
	have their files laid out in this format.
	The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a
	robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source
	toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
	and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a
	full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
	This is required to enable DHX login support, which
	will encrypt all of the passwords being sent across the 
	connection. (Some old mac clients don't support this, check
	the FAQ for the section on AppleShare clients.)
	Check to see if your unix has OpenSSL already, or
	get everything at http://www.openssl.org/ 

--with-uams-path=path: path to UAMs [default=PKGCONF/uams]

--enable-fhs: use Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) compatibility

--with-ssl-dir=PATH: specify path to openssl installation (must contain
	lib and include dirs) 

--enable-pgp-uam: enable build of PGP UAM module

--enable-krb4-uam: enable build of Kerberos v4 UAM module

--enable-overwrite: Overwrite configuration files in PKGCONFDIR

----------------------------------------------------------------

3. make

Compile all of the programs.  
Note: GNU make is required to build netatalk.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4. make install
Install the programs in the places specified by the ./configure process.
