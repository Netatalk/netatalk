desired features (in no particular order):
    afpd:
        return the right version-specific error codes
        honor the readonly/deleteinhibit/renameinhibit/copyprotect bits.
        via a database (that handles ro media, -db <path>):
        	Add afp_fileid capabilities - done
        	Add afp_catalogue
		afp_enumerate optimization
		cname expansion to handle 8+3 and 255-unicode.
        server messages in useful places 
        Other useful bits of AFP 2.0/2.1. are there any?
	change afp/ddp child handling to be in line w/ generic?
        administrative control program (using asip API?)
	appledouble v2 (gets us persistent DIDs). we'll need a did
	        database for non-hfs volumes. i think mmapping a
	        bitmap with dids at the root level should work.
		also, v2 gets us much better prodos support and
		provides for shortname support. - done 
	various toggles to afpd.conf (-timeout, etc.)
	figure out more ways of optimizing things. current places
	        of interest:
		1) reading/writing. currently there's character 
		   replacement. we should have a better way of doing
		   it that speeds things up the no-replacement case.
		   i've already done that for the crlf case.
		2) use of mmap where appropriate. NOTE: this will only
                   be a win if we mmap heavily used files. likely
		   candidates include file-based databases. mmapping 
		   header files is actually pretty slow under linux.
		3) change lookup algorithms where appropriate. 
	ability to interact with hfs desktop databases (either by
	        changing hfs or changing afpd).
        support for system-wide messages; send the main afpd process SIGUSR2
                and each of the children should send out the same message.
        replacement of a linefeed with the appropriate Macintosh character in
                server messaging (currently replaces with a space)
        a way to find out not only who is logged in, but where they're logged
                in from.  utmp/wtmp support would be best
        support picking up items from dropboxes without linux-side superuser
                intervention
		
    papd: implementing uams would be a good idea
	 
        
things to fix:
        cleaner separation of layers.
	fcntl-style byte locks - almost done. it just needs to do a
        little sorting to get around a race condition.
	AFP <-> Unix permissions. there are a couple cases where they 
		don't map perfectly. in particular, gid == 0 means
		ignore group permissions while uid == 0 means anybody
                can fiddle with this file. in addition, we need to be
		able to still change permissions on a directory with u-a
		set. finally, we need to adjust the offspring count
		for directories based upon what permissions they
		have. i.e., search -> can see directories. 
		            read -> can see files.
		we need to map permissions so that these semantics get
                followed.
        real variable DIDs for now: it turns out that afpd lies about
                this and says that it's doing fixed dids. bad bad
                bad. i just have to implement Open/CloseDir and fiddle
                a little with did assignment. argh. apple's appleshare
		client doesn't like non-fixed directory ids. 

added features:
	more of AFP 2.0!
	sped up of_findname and of_dealloc.
	increased AFP compliance w.r.t. open forks and renames:
	        wordperfect and simpletext now both work!
        nfs quota support
	solaris beta STREAMS driver added.
	64-bit cleanup
	cleaner startup/takedown
        added debug messages to dsi_write areas.
	fixed server info unexpected disconnects (due to OT bug).
        afp/ddp and afp/tcp cohabitation. afp/ddp and afp/tcp can
	operate separately now (-T turns off tcp, -D turns off ddp).
	incorporated the netbsd patches 
		[source: wrstuden@loki.stanford.edu (Bill Studenmund)]
	added/fixed quota support for linux/bsd4.4
	codepage support/casefolding on a per volume basis.
	expanded per-volume options
	added "generic" platform support for AFP/tcp.
	dynamically loaded uams	
	:ETCDIR:/afppasswd file for randnum passwds
	can turn off .AppleDouble generation.
	AppleVolumes variable substitions
    	atalkd: zones on single interfaces and the ability to control
		which interfaces get routes between them.
